School Cards work like [[Enchantment Cards]] but they can never be disabled or discarded by any means, voluntary or otherwise.

This Cards also can have triggers and modifiers that carry over from battle to battle or even to exploration.

These represent the training and traits the hunter has ingrained into him from the school where he hails.
