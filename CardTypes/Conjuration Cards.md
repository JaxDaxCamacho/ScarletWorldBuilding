This cards represent Special otherworldly abilities that the hunters may invoke or convoke in times of need.

They can vary from fireballs, to miracles and to the summoning of lesser creatures.

Spells normally have the same components as an Ability Card but it normally requires extra Resources like Polarization or Mana Tokens (Normally obtained from School Cards and Enchantments)
