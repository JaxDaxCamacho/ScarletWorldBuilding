Name: Elara Coelho
Faction: Independent / Nova Lisboa Merchants
Description: A sharp-tongued woman in her early 40s, Elara runs the largest general store in Nova Lisboa. She came to the Golden Lands with her husband, who died in the second month to a creature attack. Rather than return to the mainland in grief, she took over his supply business and built it into something larger.

She sells everything: food, rope, torches, camping gear, basic tools, and imported goods from the Empire. Her prices are fair but not generous — she's learned that charity in the Golden Lands is a quick path to bankruptcy. Despite her pragmatism, she quietly provides free supplies to widows and orphans, funding it through slightly higher prices on luxury items.

Elara has no patience for [[Ferro]]'s shakedown tactics and has publicly refused to pay their "protection fees." This has made her a target, but also a rallying point for colonists tired of being pushed around.

**Dialogue (First Meeting):**
"Welcome to Coelho Supply. Need something? I've got it. Need something you can't find? Give me two weeks and double the price. Need protection from those iron-clad bastards who call themselves soldiers? Well, we've all got problems, don't we? I'm Elara. My husband died so I could stand here and haggle with mercenaries over rope prices. Make me a fair offer and I'll treat you right. Waste my time and you'll find out why no one in this town crosses me twice."

**Quest Hooks:**
- **[[Protection Racket]]** — Ferro has been demanding protection money. Elara refuses to pay. She needs someone to make them back off without causing an all-out war.
- **[[Missing Shipment]]** — A supply caravan from the coast has disappeared. Elara needs someone to find out what happened.
- **[[The Widow's Fund]]** — Elara secretly supports families who lost providers to monster attacks. She needs discreet help expanding this network.
