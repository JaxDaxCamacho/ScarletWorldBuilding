Name: Mother Helena
Faction: Civilian / Independent
Description: An elderly woman in her late 60s, Mother Helena arrived in the Golden Lands with nothing after her entire family died during the voyage. Rather than succumb to despair, she dedicated herself to helping others in similar situations. She runs a soup kitchen in the Slum District, feeding anyone who comes — regardless of their past or affiliations.

She's tiny, frail-looking, and seemingly harmless. But Mother Helena commands immense respect. Even [[Ferro]] mercenaries don't touch her kitchen. The unspoken rule is that anyone who harms Mother Helena answers to the entire Slum District — and possibly the Guard as well, since Captain Duarte Alloro quietly appreciates that she reduces the colony's starvation problem.

Helena sees everything that happens in the Slum District. She knows who sells drugs, who steals, who's desperate enough to do anything. But she judges no one — her philosophy is that everyone deserves food and kindness, regardless of their sins.

Location: Mother Helena's Kitchen, Slum District
Role: Quest Giver, Information Source, Moral Compass

**As Service Provider:**
- Free Meals: Available to anyone, no questions asked
- Shelter: Crude but warm — can house up to 10 people in emergencies
- Information: Will share what she knows for free, but only if the purpose is good
- Sanctuary: Her kitchen is neutral ground — fighting here brings consequences

**Disposition:**
- Starts Friendly toward everyone (universal respect)
- Will not help with violence or revenge
- Provides information freely if it helps people
- Has a soft spot for [[Young Paulo]] — he reminds her of her lost grandson
- Even [[Renato Gomes]] gives her a wide berth — harming her would be bad for business

**Dialogue (First Meeting):**
"Oh, a hunter! Come, come, sit. You look like you've been fighting. Eat first — the soup is hot, and a full stomach makes for clear thinking. I'm Mother Helena. Everyone calls me that, though I never had children of my own. This kitchen is my family now. You're welcome here, child. Just leave your weapons at the door — metaphorically speaking. This is a place of peace. The only fight you'll find here is against hunger, and that's one we all face together."

**Quest Hooks:**
- **[[Soup Kitchen Supplies]]** — Helena's supply line has been disrupted. She needs help securing food shipments.
- **[[The Disappeared]]** — Several people who ate at her kitchen have vanished. She's worried something is targeting the desperate.
- **[[A Mother's Request]]** — Helena wants to find a specific colonist — a young woman who came on the same ship and then disappeared.
- **[[Neutral Ground]]** — Helena needs someone to mediate a dispute between two street gangs before violence erupts.
