Name: "Young" Paulo
Faction: Civilian / Nova Lisboa Street Folk
Description: A street-smart teenager of about 15, Paulo has survived on his own in Nova Lisboa since arriving as an orphan on one of the first ships. He makes his living as a messenger, guide, and occasional thief — though he's careful never to steal from anyone who might actually miss what he takes. He knows every alley, hidden passage, and shortcut in the colony.

Paulo has attached himself to the Scarlet Company's presence in town, hoping to one day become a hunter himself. For now, he offers his services as a guide and informant, trading information for coin or the occasional meal. He's quick, observant, and surprisingly trustworthy for a street rat — he's learned that reputation matters when you have nothing else.

Recently, Paulo has been noticing things: strangers who don't fit in, conversations that stop when he gets close, and packages being moved at odd hours. He doesn't know what it all means, but he's pretty sure something big is happening in Nova Lisboa.

**Dialogue (First Meeting):**
"You're Scarlet Company! I knew it — the way you walk, the gear. I'm Paulo. Young Paulo, they call me, because there's an Old Paulo who sweeps the docks and he's ancient. I know this city better than anyone. Every shortcut, every hiding spot, every guard patrol schedule. Need something found? Need to find someone? Need to not be found? I'm your man. Well, boy. I'm your boy. For now. One day I'll be a hunter, just like you."

**Quest Hooks:**
- **[[The Stolen Ledger]]** — Paulo saw someone steal a ledger from the Guard barracks. He knows who, but he's scared to talk.
- **[[Street Justice]]** — Ferro mercenaries beat Paulo badly. He wants justice — or revenge.
- **[[Hunter Training]]** — Paulo asks the player to train him. This could lead to a questline where he becomes a recruitable companion.
- **[[The Shadow Network]]** — Paulo knows other street kids with useful skills. He could build an information network for the player.
