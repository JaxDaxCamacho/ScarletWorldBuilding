Name: Father Mateus Correia
Faction: Church of the Red God / Fifth Holy Empire
Description: The senior Red Priest of Nova Lisboa's small temple. In his early 60s, with sun-weathered skin and burn scars on his left hand from ritual fire-handling. He arrived with the first wave of colonists and has seen more death in these lands than he cares to count. Unlike many priests who spout doctrine, Mateus is pragmatic — he believes the Red God helps those who help themselves.

He performs last rites for colonists killed by creatures, blesses new buildings, and oversees the sacred flame that burns eternally in the temple. He is one of the few people in Nova Lisboa who can perform the ritual purification required before certain monsters can be safely harvested for alchemical components.

Mateus has grown troubled by reports of "blessed" creatures in the wilderness — monsters that seem to burn with divine fire, as if touched by the Red God Himself. He doesn't know if this is a sign of favor or a corruption of the faith.

**Dialogue (First Meeting):**
"Ah, Scarlet Company. The Red God's flame burns for all who fight the darkness. Even mercenaries. Come, light a candle for those you've lost — or those you haven't lost yet. In these lands, the difference is often just a matter of time."

**Quest Hook:**
Father Mateus has heard reports of a creature in the wilderness that burns with holy fire — alive, but consecrated. He wants to know if the Red God is blessing these lands... or if something has corrupted His influence. This could lead to an investigation quest involving a "blessed" monster.
