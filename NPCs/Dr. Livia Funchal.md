Name: Dr. Livia Funchal
Faction: Civilian / Imperial Medical Corps (Retired)
Description: A sharp-witted woman in her early 50s, Dr. Funchal served as a battlefield surgeon in the Empire's wars before accepting a posting to the Golden Lands — partly for the challenge, partly to escape a political scandal that would have ended her career. She runs the colony's only proper infirmary, a cramped building where she treats everything from creature wounds to colonial diseases.

She has a dry, sometimes dark sense of humor and zero patience for foolishness. She respects hunters who understand their own limits and knows when to bring someone to her rather than trying to fix wounds themselves. She's particularly interested in the Golden Lands' native creatures — specifically, how their venom, blood, and organs might be used medicinally.

Dr. Funchal has been documenting unusual medical cases: colonists who heal impossibly fast, wounds that close without treatment, and rare instances of "blessing sickness" — patients who develop fevers and glowing veins after contact with certain creatures.

**Dialogue (First Meeting):**
"Oh good, more patients who think bandages are for the weak. I'm Dr. Funchal. If you're bleeding, come inside. If you're dying, try to do it quietly — I have other patients. And if you're here to tell me about the wonders of prayer over medicine, the temple is two streets east. Otherwise, welcome to the finest — and only — infirmary in this godforsaken paradise. What's wrong with you?"

**Quest Hooks:**
- **[[Blessing Sickness]]** — Several colonists have developed fevers and glowing veins after encountering creatures. Dr. Funchal needs samples to study.
- **[[The Autopsy]]** — A colonist died under mysterious circumstances. Dr. Funchal suspects creature involvement but needs someone to investigate.
- **[[Medical Shortage]]** — Supplies are running low. A caravan was supposed to bring medicine but never arrived.
- **[[Specimen Collection]]** — Dr. Funchal pays well for intact organs from specific creatures.
