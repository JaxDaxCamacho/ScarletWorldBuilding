Name: Renato Gomes
Faction: [[Ferro]]
Description: Field Captain of the Manapula de Ferro detachment in the Golden Lands. Mid-30s, handsome in a rough way, always smiling. He wears his Ferro armor like a second skin and speaks with an easy confidence that masks a ruthless pragmatism. Unlike the Scarlet Company, Renato doesn't hunt monsters for glory or duty — he hunts for profit, and anything else that turns a coin is fair game.

He arrived in Nova Lisboa three months before the Scarlet Company and has already embedded himself in the colony's underworld. He runs a side operation manufacturing and distributing "Golden Ash" — a potent recreational drug refined from a native Golden Lands plant. He uses Ferro soldiers as distributors and enforcers.

Renato is not stupid. He is charismatic, well-connected, and always has a contingency plan. He sees the Scarlet Company as both competition for guard contracts and a potential threat to his side business.

**Disposition:**
- Starts Condescending toward the player — sees Scarlet Company as overhyped
- If player confronts him and wins: Becomes Wary. Respects strength but holds a grudge.
- If player cuts a deal with him: Becomes a transactional ally. Will trade favors and information but will betray the player the moment it's profitable.
- If player reports him to the guard: Becomes a dangerous enemy. Escapes arrest and operates from the shadows. Will sabotage Scarlet Company contracts.
- If player kills him: Ferro company sends a replacement — meaner and less willing to talk.
