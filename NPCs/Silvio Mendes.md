Name: Silvio Mendes
Faction: Civilian / Nova Lisboa Colonist
Description: A weathered farmer in his late 50s, Silvio was among the first colonists to establish farmland outside Nova Lisboa's walls. He lost his wife to illness during the voyage and his eldest son to a creature attack three months ago. He now works his plot with his remaining son, Marco, and harbors a deep bitterness toward the Empire for "promising paradise and delivering hell."

Despite his hardships, Silvio is practical and hardworking. He grows crops that feed the colony and knows the land around his farm better than most. He's willing to share his knowledge with hunters who treat him with respect — and desperate enough to pay well for protection when creatures threaten his fields.

Recently, Silvio has noticed strange growth patterns in his crops. Plants are growing faster than normal, with unusual colors. He's not sure if this is a blessing or a sign of something wrong with the soil.

**Dialogue (First Meeting):**
"Another hunter. Good. Maybe you'll actually kill something before it eats my remaining son. The last ones — Ferro, they called themselves — took my money and then said the creature that took my livestock 'wasn't their problem.' So tell me, Scarlet — what makes you different? What will you actually do when something comes crawling out of the dark?"

**Quest Hooks:**
- **[[Crop Circles]]** — Strange patterns have appeared in Silvio's fields overnight. The crops inside are mutated. Something is affecting the land.
- **[[Night Watch]]** — Silvio's farm is being stalked by creatures. He needs hunters to patrol for several nights.
- **[[The Lost Son]]** — Marco has gone missing after following a "strange light" into the woods. Silvio is desperate to find him.
