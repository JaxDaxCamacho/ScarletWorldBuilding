**Disposition:**
- If player was respectful and solved the barghest problem: Grateful. Will provide information about strange sightings in the city in future quests. Becomes a sympathetic civilian contact.
- If player was dismissive or intimidating: Hostile. Will refuse to help in the future and may speak against the Scarlet Company to other colonists.
- If player used Persuasion successfully: She feels heard. May later ask the player for help with a personal matter (recovering her husband's belongings from the sewer).
