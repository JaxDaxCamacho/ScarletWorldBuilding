Name: Tomas Branco
Faction: Independent / Nova Lisboa Entertainment
Description: The owner and bartender of The Gilded Barrel, the most popular tavern in Nova Lisboa. Tomas is a portly man in his 50s with a thick mustache and an easy laugh. He came to the Golden Lands after losing everything to a bad business deal in the Empire — a gambling addiction that he claims is "under control" now.

The Gilded Barrel serves as neutral ground where guards, colonists, merchants, and mercenaries (except Ferro, whom Tomas has banned) can drink without fighting. Tomas has a gift for reading people and defusing tensions before they escalate. He's also an excellent source of information — people talk freely after a few drinks, and Tomas listens carefully.

He owes money to several people, including [[Andrej Vasick]]. He's terrified that his past gambling habits will catch up with him in a place where debts are often settled with blades rather than coin.

**Dialogue (First Meeting):**
"Ha! Scarlet Company! Welcome, welcome, welcome! Sit, sit! First round's on the house — you boys and girls have been busy killing the things that want to kill us. Least I can do is offer decent ale. I'm Tomas, this is my barrel, and you'll find no finer drinking establishment in the entire Golden Lands. Which, yes, I know, means 'the only one within a hundred miles,' but still! I take pride. So — what'll it be? Room? Food? Or perhaps you're looking for information? I have excellent ears, and people have very loose tongues after my special wine..."

**Quest Hooks:**
- **[[A Quiet Word]]** — Tomas overhears a conversation about a planned assassination. He needs someone to investigate discreetly.
- **[[Debts and Debts]]** — Tomas's gambling debts are catching up with him. [[Andrej Vasick]] wants payment, and Tomas doesn't have it.
- **[[The Banned Soldiers]]** — Ferro mercenaries have been threatening Tomas for banning them. They've promised to "make an example" of him.
- **[[Tall Tales]]** — A drunk patron told a story about a hidden treasure. Tomas thinks there might be truth to it.
