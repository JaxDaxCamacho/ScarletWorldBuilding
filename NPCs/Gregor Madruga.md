Name: Gregor Madruga
Faction: Independent / Nova Lisboa Artisans
Description: A massive blacksmith in his late 40s, Gregor was trained at the Imperial Armories before a gambling debt forced him to flee to the Golden Lands. His work is excellent — he's one of the few people in Nova Lisboa who can repair Scarlet Company equipment properly — but his prices reflect his skill.

He's gruff, honest to a fault, and harbors a deep resentment toward the noble families who "bought their way out of real work" back in the Empire. He sees the Golden Lands as a place where a man can make his own fortune without owing anyone. He has a soft spot for hunters who treat their equipment with respect.

Gregor has a secret: he's been experimenting with Golden Lands metals and has discovered that some of the ore here has unusual properties. He hasn't told anyone because he doesn't know if it's valuable or dangerous.

**Dialogue (First Meeting):**
"Scarlet Company, eh? Good. Means you know how to use what I sell. Too many colonists think a sword's a magic wand that solves problems by itself. No — a sword solves problems when it's in the hands of someone who trained for years. You want quality work? I'm the only game in town. Pay my prices, respect my craft, and I'll keep you armed better than any noble's private guard."

**Quest Hook:**
Gregor has been smelting ore from the Golden Lands and has produced a few test pieces with strange properties — blades that stay sharp longer, armor that seems to deflect more than it should. He needs someone to field-test this equipment against real monsters and report back on performance. He can't sell it to just anyone without knowing if it's safe.
