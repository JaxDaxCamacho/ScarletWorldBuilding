Name: Captain Duarte Alloro
Faction: Nova Lisboa City Guard
Description: Commander of Nova Lisboa's city guard. A stern older man in his late 50s, weathered by decades of imperial service. He was sent to the Golden Lands as punishment for disagreeing with a general back home — a fact he doesn't hide. Overworked, cynical, but deeply competent. He does not trust mercenaries but desperately needs them. Underneath the gruff exterior he genuinely cares about the colonists under his protection.

He has a particular disdain for [[Ferro]] mercenaries, who he considers undisciplined thugs. He tolerates the [[The Scarlet Company]] because their reputation precedes them — but respect must still be earned.
