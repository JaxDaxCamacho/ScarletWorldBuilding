Name: Sister Ines Varela
Faction: Church of the Red God / Fifth Holy Empire
Description: A young Red Priest acolyte in her mid-20s, recently arrived from the mainland. She has pale skin that burns easily in the Golden Lands' harsh sun and an earnest, sometimes naive devotion to the faith. She believes the Golden Lands are a test from the Red God — a crucible to purify the faithful.

Ines runs the temple's charity efforts: distributing food to the poor, tending to the sick, and organizing labor crews for colonists who have lost family members. She is idealistic and tends to see the best in people, which makes her vulnerable to manipulation — but also makes her a fierce advocate for those the Empire has forgotten.

She has noticed that some of the "miracles" attributed to the Red God in Nova Lisboa seem... wrong. Wounds that heal too fast, people who survive impossible falls, fires that burn without fuel. She hasn't told Father Mateus yet because she fears he'll think she's lost her faith.

**Dialogue (First Meeting):**
"The Scarlet Company! Oh, I've heard such stories about your hunters. Is it true you train for years before you're allowed to face even a single monster? The Red God grants strength to those who prepare. May I — may I ask a blessing over you? For protection, I mean. It's the least I can offer."

**Quest Hook:**
Ines has been documenting strange occurrences around Nova Lisboa — people surviving wounds that should have killed them, children with glowing eyes for days after visiting certain areas, and animals that flee from nothing. She wants to understand if the Golden Lands are blessed or cursed, but Father Mateus dismisses her concerns. She needs someone to help her investigate without alarming the church hierarchy.
