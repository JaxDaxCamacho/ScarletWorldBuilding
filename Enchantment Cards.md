Enchantment Cards are cards that define some sort of passive ability that normally triggers on it's own without the need for manual action. Normally by accumulating or spending tokens. They don't need to be played and so they don't have action costs.

Some might contain manually triggered abilities that used the amount of tokens on them as resources for whatever ability they trigger.
