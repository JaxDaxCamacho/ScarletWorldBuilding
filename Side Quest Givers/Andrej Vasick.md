Name: Andrej Vasick
Faction: Independent / Nova Lisboa Underworld
Description: Mid-40s, wiry, perpetually nervous. A former imperial merchant who lost his trade license after a tax evasion scandal back in the mainland. He came to the Golden Lands to reinvent himself, but old habits die hard. He leases warehouse space at the docks and smuggles "recreational dust" imported from the empire. He's not violent by nature — he's a businessman who would rather pay his way out of trouble than fight.

Despite being a criminal, Andrej is not without conscience. He refuses to deal in anything that directly harms children or gets people killed. He draws a hard line at Golden Ash — the far more dangerous native drug that [[Renato Gomes]] and [[Ferro]] have been pushing. This distinction is what drives the [[Drugs Running Rampant]] quest.
