# Drugs Running Rampant

**Prerequisite:** Player helped [[Andrej Vasick]] move his crates during [[Sensitive Cargo]] (Option 1 — notified Andrej before the captain)

**Unlock:** After completing both [[Territory Dispute]] and [[Sensitive Cargo]], Andrej sends a message to the player requesting a meeting at his warehouse.

---

## 1. Meet Andrej at the Warehouse

*Unlock Andrej's Warehouse Location*

Andrej is pacing. Two of his crates are smashed open. He looks more agitated than usual.

### Opening Dialogue

**Andrej:**
"Hunter, thank you for coming. I have a problem — and before you say it, yes, another one. But this time it's not centipedes."

He gestures at the smashed crates.

"Someone's been muscling in on my territory. Not just competition — they're selling something new. They call it 'Golden Ash.' It's refined from some plant native to this cursed land. And it's... bad. People aren't just getting high — they're losing their minds. Violent outbursts, hallucinations, two people dead this week."

**Player Options:**

1. **"And you care because...?"**
	1.1 "Because the guard is cracking down on ALL dust trade now! They don't distinguish between my harmless import and this Golden Ash poison. If this continues, I lose everything. And... yes, fine, people are dying. I'm not a monster, Hunter."
	→ Continue to 2

2. **"Do you know who's behind it?"**
	2.1 "I have suspicions. The [[Ferro]] mercenaries that arrived before you — they've been awfully comfortable for soldiers on a colonial contract. Their captain, [[Renato Gomes]], has been seen in the slums more than any legitimate merc should be."
	→ Continue to 3

3. **"What do you want me to do about it?"**
	3.1 "Find the source. Shut it down. I'll pay you 200 Crowns — and my undying loyalty, for whatever that's worth to a Scarlet Hunter."
	→ Continue to Investigation

---

## 2. Investigation — The Slums

*Unlock Slum District Location*

The player can investigate the Golden Ash problem through multiple paths:

### Path A: Talk to the Addicts

In the slum district, several colonists huddle around burning barrels. One of them, a young woman named **Marta**, is coherent enough to talk.

**Marta:**
"The Ash... it makes you see the golden light. Like the sun itself is inside your skull. It's beautiful... until it isn't."

**Player Options:**

1. **"Where do you get it?"**
	1.1 "There's a man... comes at night. Wears iron-colored armor under a cloak. Sells it by the vial from a cart near the old fishery."
	→ Unlocks Old Fishery Location

2. **"What happens when it goes wrong?"** [Beast Lore > Metamorphosis]
	Success: Marta describes symptoms you recognize — dilated pupils, gold-tinged veins, violent episodes followed by total collapse. This isn't just a drug. The plant base is likely mutagenic. Whoever is refining this doesn't know — or doesn't care — that it's causing alchemical poisoning.
	Failure: The symptoms sound terrible but you can't identify what's causing the extreme reactions. Something beyond normal recreational effects.

3. [Close Conversation] **"Get clean. This stuff will kill you."**

### Path B: Investigate the Old Fishery

The Old Fishery is an abandoned building near the waterfront. At night, a cart with iron-colored tarp appears. A Ferro soldier in a cloak sells vials of golden liquid to desperate colonists.

**Player Options:**

1. **Follow the cart when it leaves** → Leads to Ferro Warehouse on the outskirts. Unlock Ferro Warehouse Location.

2. **Confront the dealer** → The Ferro soldier panics, draws his sword. Quick fight (1x Ferro Soldier — similar stats to a basic NPC with Martial cards). After defeating or intimidating him, he reveals the warehouse location.
	"Please! I'm just a runner! The captain — Gomes — he runs everything from the warehouse outside the walls!"
	→ Unlock Ferro Warehouse Location

3. **Buy a sample and bring it to Andrej** → Andrej confirms it's Golden Ash. Refined. Professional operation. "This is no back-alley brew. Whoever is making this has resources."
	→ Unlock Ferro Warehouse Location through Andrej's contacts

---

## 3. The Ferro Warehouse

*Unlock Ferro Warehouse Location (outside city walls)*

A converted colonial storehouse flying the Ferro banner. Two guards at the entrance. Inside: refining equipment, crates of raw golden plant material, and vials of finished Golden Ash. [[Renato Gomes]] is present, overseeing a shipment.

When the player arrives, the guards block the entrance.

**Ferro Guard:**
"This is Ferro territory, Scarlet. Turn around."

**Player Options:**

1. **"I'm here to see your captain. Move."** [Intimidation]
	Success: The guards exchange nervous looks and step aside. "Your funeral, merc."
	Failure: "We don't take orders from you. Get lost." → Must fight or find another way in.

2. **Force your way in** → Combat begins. 2x Ferro Soldiers (MaxAP 2, Evasion 12, Armor 2, Ferro Shortsword +2 to Hit, 3-5 Damage). After defeating them, enter the warehouse.

3. **Find a side entrance** [Subterfuge check, flat roll 10+]
	Success: You find an unguarded loading dock. Slip inside undetected. You overhear Renato giving orders — valuable intelligence.
	Failure: A guard spots you. Combat with 1x Ferro Soldier, then enter normally.

---

## 4. Confrontation with Renato Gomes

Inside the warehouse, [[Renato Gomes]] sits behind a desk covered in ledgers and coin. He's not surprised to see you.

**Renato:**
"Ah. Scarlet Company. I was wondering when you'd show up. Sit down, please. No need for this to get... uncivilized."

He pours two glasses of wine.

"Let me guess — the nervous little smuggler at the docks sent you. Vasick. He's upset because my product is better than his. Free market, no?"

**Player Options:**

1. **"Your product is killing people."**
	1.1 Renato shrugs. "Everything in this land kills people. The creatures, the weather, the food. At least Golden Ash lets them feel something good before the end. But fine — you want to talk morality? Let's talk business instead."
	→ Continue to Renato's Offer

2. **"Shut it down. Now."**
	2.1 "Or what? You'll fight me? My men? We're not centipedes, Hunter. We're trained soldiers. And I have twenty of them within shouting distance. But..." He holds up a hand. "I'm a reasonable man. Hear me out."
	→ Continue to Renato's Offer

3. **"I've seen enough."** [Draw weapon — immediately start combat]
	→ Skip to Encounter

4. **"Convince me this is worth my time."**
	4.1 "Smart. I like that. Scarlet Company with a brain."
	→ Continue to Renato's Offer

### Renato's Offer

**Renato:**
"Here's what I propose. You're new here. I've been here three months. I know this city, the people, the guard patrols, the creature patterns. That information is worth more than whatever Vasick is paying you."

"Walk away. Forget this warehouse. In return, I'll make sure Ferro never competes for your contracts. I'll even throw in 300 Crowns and a standing offer — any intelligence you need about the Golden Lands, I'm your man."

"Or we can do this the hard way. Your choice."

**Player Options:**

1. **"Deal. Vasick can sort out his own problems."** [FAME -]
	→ Ending A: The Deal

2. **"I'll take your money. But the Golden Ash production stops. Dust is one thing — this is poison."** [Persuasion]
	Success: → Ending B: The Compromise
	Failure: "You don't get to negotiate. Take the deal as offered or don't." → Player must choose option 1, 3, or 4.

3. **"I don't make deals with drug runners."** [FAME +]
	→ Ending D: Report to the Guard, or Ending C: Combat

4. **"Here's MY offer. You stop the Ash. Supply Vasick's operation instead. Everybody profits, nobody dies."** [Persuasion]
	Success: → Ending E: The Merger
	Failure: Renato laughs. "You think you can just... reorganize my business? Adorable." → Must choose another option.

---

## 5. Endings

### Ending A: The Deal [FAME -]

You accept Renato's offer. He hands you a pouch of 300 Crowns.

**Renato:**
"Pleasure doing business, Hunter. I knew Scarlet Company were pragmatists."

**Consequences:**
- Gain 300 Crowns
- [[Ferro]] becomes Neutral toward you (will not compete for contracts)
- [[Renato Gomes]] becomes a contact — can be visited for Golden Lands intelligence
- [[Andrej Vasick]] is Disappointed — "You sold me out for coin. I expected more from the Scarlet Company." (Loses trader discount, but remains available)
- Golden Ash continues to spread in Nova Lisboa. Addicts increase. [[Captain Duarte Alloro]] grows frustrated with the growing drug problem and may blame the Scarlet Company for inaction later.

---

### Ending B: The Compromise [FAME neutral]

Renato reluctantly agrees to stop Golden Ash production.

**Renato:**
"Fine. The Ash goes. But my other operations continue — and you never set foot in this warehouse again. Are we clear?"

**Consequences:**
- Gain 300 Crowns
- Golden Ash production stops — addict crisis stabilizes
- [[Ferro]] becomes Cautious toward you (respects your leverage but resents you)
- [[Renato Gomes]] keeps his other smuggling operations. Remains a background presence.
- [[Andrej Vasick]] is Relieved — "The Ash is gone? You're a miracle worker, Hunter." (Gives a one-time gift of 3 Material Tokens)
- [[Captain Duarte Alloro]] notices the improvement but doesn't know why. No fame change.

---

### Ending C: Combat [FAME +]

If the player refuses the deal and draws weapons, or if persuasion fails and they choose violence.

background Ferro Warehouse battle

Combat begins.
1x [[Renato Gomes]] (Boss — MaxAP 4, Evasion 13, Armor 4, Ferro Sabre +4 to Hit 4-6 Damage, Parrying Dagger +2 Evade. Uses Charge, Disarm, and Riposte)
3x Ferro Soldiers (MaxAP 2, Evasion 12, Armor 2, Ferro Shortsword +2 to Hit 3-5 Damage)

Special Rule: Renato will attempt to flee (disengage and move toward exit) if he drops below 25% health. If he escapes, he becomes a recurring enemy. If killed, Ferro sends a replacement.

**After Combat:**

If Renato is killed:
"You find ledgers detailing the entire Golden Ash operation, supply routes, and the names of Ferro soldiers involved."
→ Can bring evidence to [[Captain Duarte Alloro]]

If Renato escaped:
"The warehouse is yours, but Gomes is gone. His ledgers are partially burned — he's careful. But you find enough to prove Ferro involvement."
→ Can bring partial evidence to [[Captain Duarte Alloro]]

**Consequences:**
- Gain whatever loot is on Renato (if killed) + Ferro Sabre + Parrying Dagger
- [[Ferro]] becomes Hostile — will actively sabotage Scarlet Company contracts going forward
- [[Captain Duarte Alloro]] is impressed — "You took on Ferro? Bold. Stupid, maybe. But bold." [FAME +]
- [[Andrej Vasick]] is Terrified but grateful — "You... you fought Ferro? For me? I owe you my life, Hunter." (Permanent trader discount, unlocks rare stock)
- Golden Ash production is disrupted. Crisis eases for now.

---

### Ending D: Report to the Guard [FAME +]

Player leaves the warehouse (with or without confrontation) and reports to [[Captain Duarte Alloro]].

**Captain Duarte:**
"Ferro? Running drugs inside MY city? Those miserable dogs. I'll send a detachment to raid the warehouse at dawn."

**Player Options:**

1. **"I'll lead the raid with your men."**
	→ Combat encounter at the warehouse (same as Ending C but with 2x Guard Soldiers fighting alongside you. Renato has 2 additional Ferro Soldiers as reinforcement.)
	[FAME +]

2. **"I've done my part. The rest is yours, Captain."**
	→ The raid happens off-screen. Renato is captured (50% chance) or escapes (50% chance — determined by player's earlier investigation thoroughness. If player followed the cart AND interrogated the dealer, Renato is captured. Otherwise he escapes.)
	[FAME +]

**Consequences:**
- Gain 150 Crowns (official bounty from the guard)
- [[Captain Duarte Alloro]] respect increases significantly. Unlocks future guard contracts.
- [[Ferro]] detachment in Nova Lisboa is weakened. Some soldiers arrested, others desert.
- If Renato captured: He's imprisoned but Ferro will negotiate his release eventually. He remembers who put him there.
- If Renato escaped: He operates from outside the city walls. Becomes a persistent threat.
- [[Andrej Vasick]] is nervous — "The guard raided Ferro? I hope they don't look too hard at the rest of us..." (Remains available but slightly more cautious)

---

### Ending E: The Merger [FAME -]

Through persuasion, you convince Renato to stop Ash production and instead supply raw materials to Andrej's less dangerous dust operation. Renato gets a cut, Andrej gets supply security, and the lethal Golden Ash disappears.

**Renato:**
"Hmm. A cartel, then. With a Scarlet Hunter as the middleman. I admit, I didn't see that coming. Fine — if Vasick agrees, I'll pivot. More margin in stability anyway."

**Andrej:**
"You want me to work WITH Ferro? Are you mad? ...Actually, if they stop the Ash and I get their supply chain... this could work. Alright, Hunter. You've earned your commission."

**Consequences:**
- Gain 200 Crowns (commission from both parties)
- [[Ferro]] becomes Transactional toward you — Renato cooperates but purely for profit
- [[Andrej Vasick]] becomes a better trader — unlocks expanded stock including Ferro-sourced equipment
- [[Renato Gomes]] becomes a reluctant business partner. Can be visited for information.
- Golden Ash disappears from the streets. The less dangerous dust trade continues.
- [[Captain Duarte Alloro]] doesn't know about the arrangement. If he ever finds out, major reputation loss.
- This is a ticking time bomb — the arrangement may collapse in later acts, forcing the player to deal with the consequences.
