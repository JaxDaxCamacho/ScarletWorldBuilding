Combat is Resolved by turns.
Either the heroes or the enemies go first depending on the encounter initiation (If the party was ambushed etc).

**Reposition** represents movement in the battlefield, any creature that is mobile, can reposition by spending one action point. When it does so it **engages** with another token or **disengages** (if not [[Surrounded]]) with all currently engaged tokens.

 In the Player Turn, the Player Can:
 
Play Cards from his characters.
Reposition characters (spending one action point).
Interact with [[ObjectTokens]]
End Turn.

In The Enemy Turn:

Each enemy will take decisions on who or what to target with their abilities and do so.
When all enemies are done with actions they end their turn.
