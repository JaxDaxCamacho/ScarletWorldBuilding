Combat is Resolved by turns.
Either the heroes or the enemies go first depending on the encounter initiation (If the party was ambushed etc).

**Reposition** represents movement in the battlefield, any creature that is mobile, can reposition by spending one action point. When it does so it **engages** with another token or **disengages** (if not [[Surrounded]]) with all currently engaged tokens.

 In the Player Turn, the Player Can:
 
Play Cards from his characters.
Reposition characters (spending one action point).
Interact with [[ObjectTokens]]
End Turn.

In The Enemy Turn:

Each enemy will take decisions on who or what to target with their abilities and do so.
When all enemies are done with actions they end their turn. 


Attacks:

**Hunter on Enemy**
When performing an Attack Ability the player will select the target to the attack.
Then it rolls a 1d20 + Main Hand weapon Attack Bonus. There can be other influences to the attack bonus like Effects, Enchantments and injuries. That result needs to beat the Enemy's Evasion.
On Failure, the attack fails, the enemy evaded the attack.
On Success the attack hits but now we need to roll the weapon min-max damage to see how much damage is inflicted.
From there we can reduce the damage inflicted by the amount of the armor the monster has.
We can then check if the damage triggers any Enchantment or Effect (which could reduce the damage even further based on traits.).
The remaining damage is applied directly to the monster health points.
The monster gets injuries as their health points get closer to 0,

**Enemy on Hunter**
When the enemy attacks the hunter, it's the same initial calculation.
1d20 + Attack bonus >= Hunter Evasion
[minDamage - maxDamage] - Hunter Armor = Applied Damage
Check Enchantment/Effect Triggers

But now on applying damage to hunter's is when things change up quite a bit.
You see, hunters are only human, they can't soak up damage and hits like most monsters can, and so when they actually get hit, they get injured. Those injuries affect their ability to defend themselves and can even leave permanent scars.

The applied Damage to the hunter follows this process

if the applied Damage is less than 5 then we get a [[Light injury]] (these are normally healed pretty fast, but can accumulate to become dangerous)
if the applied Damage is 5 or more but less than 10 we get a [[Medium Injury]] (these can actually affect the hunter's stats, like their Evasion, Armor, MaxAP, AttackBonus, DamageBonus)
if the applied Damage is 10 or more but less than 20 then we get a [[Serious Injury]] (these are life threatening injuries which can cripple limbs, bleed them out rapidly or immobilize them )
If applied Damage is 20 or more then the Hunter is outright dead.
