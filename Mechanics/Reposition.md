# Reposition

Reposition is a basic action that allows a token to change its engagement status with other tokens on the battlefield.

## Action Cost

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Action Point Cost | 1 AP |
| Movement Type | Engagement change |

## Uses

Reposition can be used to:

### Engage
Move a token into melee range of another token:
- Token attaches to the target token
- Both tokens are now "engaged" with each other
- Can target any token within reasonable movement distance
- Cannot engage if [[Surrounded]] (already engaged with 4+ enemies)

### Disengage
Move a token away from an engaged token:
- Token detaches from the target token
- **Triggers [[Attack of Opportunity]]** if the disengaging token has an enemy Reaction Point available
- Cannot disengage if [[Surrounded]] — must break free through other means (abilities, ally help, killing enemies)

## Engagement Rules

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Engaged** | Tokens are attached, in melee range of each other |
| **Disengaged** | Tokens are separate, not in melee range |
| **Distant** | Token is not engaged with any enemy |

## Restrictions

| Restriction | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Surrounded | Cannot reposition at all when Surrounded |
| No AP | Cannot reposition without spending 1 AP |
| Reaction Spent | Enemy must have Reaction Point to make AoO |

## Safe Reposition

Some abilities allow repositioning without triggering Attacks of Opportunity:
- [[Disengaging Kick]] — Kick enemy away, preventing their AoO
- [[Vanish]] / [[Smoke Bomb]] — Stealth-based safe retreat
- Teleportation effects — Instant reposition, no trigger
