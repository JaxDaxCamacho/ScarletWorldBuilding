## Fame & Infamy

Fame and Infamy are two sides of the same reputation track. The same resource is measured on a single scale:

## Supplies

Supplies represent the provisions and equipment needed for overland travel and dungeon exploration.

### Supply Pool

Supplies are tracked as a pool of points. Different activities consume different amounts:

- Random encounter chance increases

### Starting Value
