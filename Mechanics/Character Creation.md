# Character Creation

Character creation follows a sequential process to build a starting Hunter for The Scarlet Company.

## Overview

| Step | Choice | Determines |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | School | Discipline proficiencies, equipment options, school card |
| 2 | Armor Kit | Evasion, Armor rating, consumable slots, card slots |
| 3 | Weapon Kit | Main hand, off hand, or two-handed weapon |
| 4 | Abilities | Hunter cards from discipline proficiencies |
| 5 | Identity | Portrait, token frame, character name |

---

## Step 1: Choose School

Each Hunter School provides:
- **Two Discipline Proficiencies** — Determines which ability cards the hunter can learn
- **Equipment Options** — 3 armor kits and 3 weapon kits to choose from
- **School Card** — A unique enchantment or ability representing school training

### Available Schools

| School | Motto | Disciplines |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| [[Carveiro]] | "Honor and Fire" | Martial & Invocation |
| [[Aelvasso]] | "Hunt the Hunter" | Martial & Metamorphosis |
| [[Tilda]] | "Forward to Dominate" | Subterfuge & Metamorphosis |
| [[Portador]] | "Alive And Striving" | Subterfuge & Survival |
| [[Rotante]] | "Know Power" | Invocation & Ecclesiastic |
| [[Selvokat]] | "Consume Nature" | Ecclesiastic & Survival |

---

## Step 2: Choose Armor Kit

Each school offers 3 armor options. The choice determines:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Evasion** | Target number for enemies to hit this hunter |
| **Armor** | Damage reduction when hit |
| **Consumable Slots** | How many consumables can be carried |
| **Card Slots** | Which discipline cards can be equipped (and how many) |

### Armor Weight Classes

| Weight | Typical Stats | Trade-off |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Light** | High Evasion, Low Armor, More Consumables | Mobility over protection |
| **Medium** | Balanced Evasion and Armor | Middle ground |
| **Heavy** | Low Evasion, High Armor, Fewer Consumables | Protection over mobility |

**Card Slot Format:** Armor specifies which disciplines can use its card slots (e.g., "3 Martial/Invocation" means 3 slots for Martial or Invocation cards).

---

## Step 3: Choose Weapon Kit

Each school offers 3 weapon loadout options:

| Loadout Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Two-Handed** | One powerful 2-handed weapon |
| **One-Handed + Shield** | Main hand weapon + shield (bonus Evasion/Armor) |
| **Dual Wield** | Main hand + off-hand weapon (versatility) |

### Weapon Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Attack Bonus** | Added to 1d20 attack roll |
| **Damage** | [min-max] damage range |
| **Damage Trait** | [[Slashing]], [[Piercing]], or [[Blunt]] — determines injury type |
| **Abilities** | Built-in attacks or special actions |

---

## Step 4: Choose Abilities

Select Hunter Cards based on:
- **Discipline Proficiencies** — Can only equip cards from the school's two disciplines
- **Card Slots** — Limited by armor's card slot capacity
- **Starting Cards** — New hunters begin with basic cards from their disciplines

### Card Selection Rules

1. Cards must match one of the hunter's two discipline proficiencies
2. Total cards cannot exceed armor's card slot limit
3. Each card has a Level requirement — starting hunters begin with Level 1 cards
4. Some cards require specific weapons (e.g., [[Shield Block]] requires a shield)

### Starting Card Pool

Each discipline has basic Level 1 cards available at character creation:

| Discipline | Example Starting Cards |
|------------|------------------------|
| Martial | [[Battle Stance]], [[Cleave]], [[Charge]] |
| Subterfuge | [[Vanish]], [[Backstab]], [[Smoke Bomb]] |
| Survival | [[Snipe]], [[Flask of Fire]], [[Ambushing Dive]] |
| Invocation | [[Flame Burst]], [[Arching Lightning]], [[Barrier]] |
| Metamorphosis | [[Alchemical Bomb]], [[Eye of The Cat]], [[Venomous Coating]] |
| Ecclesiastic | [[Miracle Heal]], [[Blessing of Light]], [[Spare the Dying]] |

---

## Step 5: Choose Identity

Final customization options:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Portrait** | Visual representation of the hunter (from available portraits) |
| **Token Frame** | Border style for the hunter's battlefield token |
| **Name** | Hunter's name (player choice) |

---

## Starting Resources

New hunters begin their career with the following resources:

| Resource | Starting Value | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Escudos** | 50 | Primary currency for purchases and services |
| **Fame** | 0 | Neutral reputation (see [[Fame]] for reputation tiers) |
| **Supplies** | 3 | Provisions for travel and exploration |

### Escudos

The currency of the Fifth Holy Empire. Used for:
- Purchasing equipment and consumables
- Paying for services (healing, information, lodging)
- Bribing NPCs

### Fame/Infamy

A single reputation track from -100 to +100:
- **Positive (Fame)**: Unlocks diplomatic options, better prices, NPC assistance
- **Negative (Infamy)**: Unlocks intimidation options, fear effects, black market access
- **Zero**: Unknown — no reputation effects

### Supplies

Consumed during travel and exploration:
- **Travel between settlements**: 1 Supply per leg
- **Explore cave/dungeon**: 2 Supplies per expedition
- **Remote locations**: 3 Supplies
- **Maximum capacity**: 10 Supplies
