# Surrounded

Surrounded is a status effect that occurs when a token is engaged with **4 or more enemy tokens** simultaneously.

## Triggering Condition

A token becomes Surrounded when:
- **4 enemy tokens** are attached (engaged) to the token
- The status applies immediately when the 4th enemy engages
- The status is removed when the number of engaged enemies drops to 3 or fewer

## Effects

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Evasion Penalty** | -4 to Evasion while Surrounded |
| **Cannot Disengage** | Cannot use [[Reposition]] to disengage from any enemy |
| **Cannot AoO** | Cannot make [[Attack of Opportunity]] against any enemy |
| **Vulnerable** | Significantly easier to hit due to penalty |

## Resolving Surrounded

To escape the Surrounded status:
1. **Kill enemies** — Reduce engaged enemies to 3 or fewer
2. **Knockback effects** — Force enemies away via abilities
3. **Allies intervene** — Allies can engage enemies to pull them off you
4. **Teleportation** — Some abilities allow escape regardless of engagement

## Visual Indicator

On the battlefield, a Surrounded token has enemies attached on all sides, limiting movement options and creating a desperate situation.
