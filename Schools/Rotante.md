"Know Power"
This school creates soldiers that use the extra corporeal energies around them to completely obliterate their enemies or bring their almost perished comrades back to life. A lot of the pupils that graduate this school actually went on to become healers instead of mercs.  
CARD:  The Rotante School Card generates 3 Energy Tokens (can be used as any resource) per turn, as long as the Rotante is uninjured. Generates only 2 if that's not the case.
Disciplines: Invocation & Ecclesiastic
