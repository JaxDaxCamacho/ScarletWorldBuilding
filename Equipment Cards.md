Equipment Cards are cards that convey abilities similarly to the other Hunter Cards.
But they may also define certain statistic bonuses to the hero that will be used by other abilities and actions.
Like weapons will define the base attack damage of some Martial abilities, [[Armor]] will give the hunter a base defense when receiving damage, shields will allow you to react to attacks to try and parry them and trickets might increase or reduced a type of damage inflicted or taken. 

If the Health Part where the equipment is slotted becomes damaged then that card cannot be used and it's stats are no longer applied.
