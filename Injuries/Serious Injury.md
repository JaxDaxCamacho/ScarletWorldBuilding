## Special Cases

### Multiple Injuries
If a Hunter receives multiple injuries in the same combat, track them all. Effects stack unless redundant (e.g., two "Burned Arm" injuries would affect both arms).

### Permanent Injuries
Injuries marked as "permanent" require advanced medical treatment, magical healing, or remain for the rest of the Hunter's career. Some may be improved but never fully cured.

### Death Threshold
Any injury that would reduce a Hunter's Max AP to 0 results in [[Unconscious]]. If a Hunter takes additional damage while unconscious and it would cause a Serious Injury, they die instead.

### Healing
- Light injuries heal automatically after combat
- Medium injuries require rest or basic medical attention
- Serious injuries require medical treatment, surgery, or magical healing
- Permanent injuries require extraordinary measures to improve
