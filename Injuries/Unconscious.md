# Unconscious

When a Hunter becomes [[Unconscious]], their token remains on the battlefield and can still be attacked.

## Effects
- Cannot take any actions
- Evasion reduced to 0 (automatic hits)
- Cannot play cards or use abilities
- Cannot reposition
- Vulnerable to [[Coup de Grâce]] (any hit while unconscious that would deal 10+ damage results in death)

## Recovery
- If caused by injuries (e.g., Brain Injury, Cardiac Arrest), recovery requires:
  - Medical attention (Ecclesiastic healing, medical supplies)
  - Successful stabilization check
  - Natural recovery after 1d4 turns (for certain injuries)
- If Max AP reaches 0 from injuries, remains unconscious until treated
- If from [[Exsanguinated]] status, must be stabilized to prevent death

## Causes
- Brain Injury (Serious Blunt)
- Cardiac Arrest (Serious Lightning)
- Frozen Solid (Serious Frost)
- Cracked Skull (Serious Blunt)
- Reaching 0 Max AP from injury effects
- Exsanguination (blood loss)
