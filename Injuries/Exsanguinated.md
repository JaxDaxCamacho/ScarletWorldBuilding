# Exsanguinated

When a Hunter becomes [[Exsanguinated]], they are bleeding out and will die without intervention.

## Effects
- Falls [[Unconscious]] immediately
- Must be stabilized within the specified number of turns or die
- Each turn while exsanguinated, continue losing Blood Points
- Cannot be woken until stabilized and bleeding stopped

## Stabilization
To stabilize an Exsanguinated Hunter:
- **Medical Supplies**: Consumable item, stops bleeding, stops Blood Point loss
- **Ecclesiastic Healing**: [[Miracle Heal]] or similar ability
- **Successful Medicine Check**: DC based on wound severity

If stabilized, Hunter remains [[Unconscious]] but no longer dying. Blood Point loss stops.
