# Ancient History of the Golden Lands

Before the Fifth Holy Empire discovered the Golden Lands, before the Scarlet Company arrived to hunt its monsters, before the first colonist set foot on its shores — there were others. The evidence is scattered, fragmentary, and often dismissed as imagination or superstition. But it exists. And those who study it closely begin to wonder what truly happened to the civilization that came before.

## Physical Evidence

### The Stone Ruins

Scattered across the Golden Lands are stone structures that predate Imperial arrival. They are not common, but they are undeniable:

**The Seaside Pillars:** Near [[Farpoint]], half-submerged in the coastal waters, stand a series of pillars covered in carvings that no Imperial scholar can translate. The carvings depict humanoid figures performing rituals around large, glowing shapes.

**The Valley Markers:** In the hills near [[Porto Verde]], stone markers have been found at regular intervals. They don't seem to mark boundaries — their purpose is unclear. Some are intact; others have been deliberately destroyed.

**The Underground Chambers:** Miners in [[Serra Alta]] have broken into chambers that weren't natural caves. The walls are smooth, too smooth, and the air inside is always cold regardless of the season. Most have been sealed by the Mining Guild for "safety reasons."

**The Coastal Temple:** A structure discovered near the landing site of the first colonists, quickly claimed by the Church of the Red God and consecrated. The original carvings were covered with holy symbols, but those who saw them first described them as showing "people becoming light."

### Artifacts

Occasional artifacts surface, usually buried or hidden:

**The Golden Discs:** Small metal discs with unknown writing. About palm-sized, warm to the touch, and seemingly indestructible. Several have been collected by the Church; others remain in private hands.

**The Crystal Spheres:** Transparent spheres that contain swirling colors. When held, some report hearing whispers or feeling emotions that aren't their own. These are considered dangerous and have been ordered destroyed by Church decree (not all have been found).

**The Bone Tools:** Tools made from bones that don't match any known creature. The craftsmanship is exquisite, far beyond what should be possible with primitive techniques.

## Theories About the Ancients

### The Ascension Theory

Some scholars believe the Ancients did not die out — they transcended. The carvings showing "people becoming light" are interpreted literally: the civilization discovered a way to abandon their physical forms and exist as pure energy or consciousness.

**Evidence For:** The lack of bodies or graves. The "blessed" creatures that seem touched by divine power. The crystal spheres that seem to contain... something.

**Evidence Against:** No mechanism for such ascension has been discovered. The theory relies heavily on interpretation of carvings.

### The Extinction Theory

The Ancients were wiped out by some catastrophe. Disease, war, or the very creatures they may have created.

**Evidence For:** The deliberate destruction of some artifacts (as if trying to hide something). The sealed chambers. The dangerous creatures that seem engineered rather than evolved.

**Evidence Against:** No mass graves. No clear signs of war. The civilization seems to have simply... stopped.

### The Departure Theory

The Ancients left. They sailed or traveled to another land, taking most of their knowledge with them.

**Evidence For:** The lack of bodies. The pillared roads near the coast (possible departure points). The empty structures that look prepared for abandonment.

**Evidence Against:** No record of other lands. No trace of where they might have gone.

### The Transformation Theory

The most disturbing theory: the Ancients didn't leave or die. They became something else. The creatures of the Golden Lands, with their impossible size and supernatural abilities, are the transformed remnants of an entire civilization.

**Evidence For:** The creature abilities that seem artificial. The "blessed" phenomenon. The bone tools made from unknown creatures.

**Evidence Against:** This theory is considered madness by most scholars. There is no mechanism for such transformation.

## The Church's Position

The Church of the Red God has taken an official stance on the Ancient ruins:

1. **All pre-Imperial structures are to be reported to the Church.** Unauthorized exploration is forbidden.
2. **The Ancients were a primitive people who died out.** The ruins are of historical interest only.
3. **Any artifacts discovered are to be turned over to the Church.** Possession is not forbidden, but it is... discouraged.
4. **The "blessed" creatures are divine tests.** They are not connected to the Ancients in any way.

Those who study the Ancients closely note that the Church's position seems designed to prevent investigation rather than encourage understanding.

## Key Sites of Interest

### The Sunken Temple

A structure discovered offshore from Nova Lisboa, accessible only at extremely low tide. It was explored once by Imperial scholars, who reported that the interior contained murals showing the sun and moon exchanging places. After that expedition, the Church declared the site dangerous and forbade further visits. The scholars who explored it were reassigned to distant postings.

### The Silent City

A ruin reported by a hunter in the deep interior. The hunter claimed to have found an entire city, intact but empty, with buildings of glass and stone. He was dismissed as a drunk until he produced a piece of glass that was clearly worked — but when he tried to lead others back to the site, he couldn't find it again.

### The Well of Echoes

Near Serra Alta, a vertical shaft of unknown depth. Miners have dropped stones into it and never heard them hit bottom. Those who listen at the edge report hearing voices — not in any language they recognize, but definitely voices. The Mining Guild has sealed it off, but the seals keep breaking.

### The Garden of Statues

A clearing in the forest where a dozen humanoid statues stand in a perfect circle. They are incredibly lifelike, each showing a different expression — fear, wonder, peace, agony. They are not weathered; they look as if they were carved yesterday. No one knows who made them or what they represent.

## Connections to Current Events

The Ancient civilization may be connected to several current mysteries in the Golden Lands:

- **The "Blessed" Creatures:** Are they remnants of Ancient experiments? Divine intervention? Or something else?
- **The Children's Dreams in Porto Verde:** Are the dreams connected to Ancient sites or artifacts?
- **The Strange Metals in Serra Alta:** Could they be Ancient in origin?
- **The Visions at Farpoint:** Are Sister Madalena's dreams prophetic or connected to something buried beneath the outpost?

The answers may lie in the ruins, the artifacts, and the stories that the Church would prefer remain buried.

## What the Players Might Discover

As the campaign progresses, players may uncover:

1. **Translation of Ancient Writing:** Partial or complete, revealing the fate of the Ancients.
2. **Functional Ancient Technology:** Artifacts that do something when activated.
3. **Survivors:** Individuals or groups who claim descent from the Ancients or knowledge of their fate.
4. **The Truth About the Creatures:** Whether the fauna is natural, engineered, or something in between.
5. **The Church's Secret:** What the Church knows and why they're suppressing it.

The Ancient history of the Golden Lands is a thread that can run through the entire campaign, providing mysteries, dangers, and revelations as players explore deeper.
