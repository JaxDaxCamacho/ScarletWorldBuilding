# Faction Dynamics in Nova Lisboa

Nova Lisboa is not simply a colony under Imperial control — it is a web of competing interests, alliances, and conflicts. Understanding the factions and their relationships is essential for anyone who wants to navigate the political landscape of the Golden Lands.

## Major Factions

### The Colonial Administration (Fifth Holy Empire)

**Leadership:** Governor-General Emilio Carvalho (based in the capital, visits rarely), [[Captain Duarte Alloro]] (local military authority)

**Interests:** Maintain order, extract resources, protect colonists, report success to the Empire

**Resources:** Official authority, Guard forces, treasury access, supply lines from the Empire

**Weaknesses:** Bureaucratic, slow to respond, underfunded, dependent on mercenaries for creature control

The Colonial Administration is the official governing body, but its power is more theoretical than practical. Governor-General Carvalho spends most of his time in the capital, leaving day-to-day governance to Captain Duarte Alloro. The Administration has authority but lacks the resources to enforce it fully.

**Relationships:**
- **The Scarlet Company:** Official contractors, valued for their effectiveness
- **[[Ferro]]:** Official contractors, tolerated despite their methods
- **Church of the Red God:** Alliance of convenience; the Church provides legitimacy
- **Colonists:** Supposed to protect them; often fails to do so
- **Merchants:** Need their cooperation for supply lines; resent their profiteering

### The Scarlet Company

**Leadership:** Field Commander (rotates), currently no single leader in Nova Lisboa

**Interests:** Fulfill contracts, maintain reputation, earn payment, preserve hunter lives

**Resources:** Elite hunters, training from Hunter Schools, combat equipment, professional discipline

**Weaknesses:** Small numbers, dependent on payment, not equipped for extended occupation

The Scarlet Company is the most elite force in the colony, but they are mercenaries, not rulers. Their power comes from their reputation and their effectiveness against creatures. They have no political ambitions — they simply want to do their job and get paid.

**Relationships:**
- **Colonial Administration:** Employers, generally positive relationship
- **[[Ferro]]:** Professional rivalry; Scarlet views Ferro as embarrassments
- **Church of the Red God:** Neutral; some hunters are faithful, others are not
- **Colonists:** Generally respected; colonists appreciate the creature control
- **Merchants:** Neutral; business relationships

### Manapula de Ferro

**Leadership:** [[Renato Gomes]] (Field Captain in Nova Lisboa)

**Interests:** Profit, political influence, information gathering, eliminating competition

**Resources:** Numbers (they have more soldiers than Scarlet), entrenched position, underworld connections, gold from Golden Ash operation

**Weaknesses:** Poor discipline, bad reputation, dependence on illegal activities, vulnerable to official crackdown

Ferro is a lesser mercenary company that arrived before Scarlet and has embedded itself deeply in Nova Lisboa's power structure. Officially, they're another contracted force for creature control. Unofficially, they've become enforcers, information brokers, and now drug traffickers through the Golden Ash operation.

**Relationships:**
- **Colonial Administration:** Official contractors; tolerated despite resentment
- **The Scarlet Company:** Rivals; viewed with contempt by Scarlet, resentment by Ferro
- **Church of the Red God:** Hostile; the Church condemns their activities
- **Colonists:** Feared and resented; they extract "protection fees"
- **Merchants:** Mixed; some are victims of extortion, others are partners in smuggling
- **Underworld:** Deep connections; they run the Golden Ash trade

### Church of the Red God

**Leadership:** [[Father Mateus Correia]] (Senior Priest), Bishop Salvador Mendes (regional authority, visits occasionally)

**Interests:** Spread the faith, protect souls, maintain influence, investigate anomalies (blessed creatures, Ancient ruins)

**Resources:** Religious authority, colonist trust, healing services, ritual powers

**Weaknesses:** No military force, dependent on cooperation with Administration, hiding something about the Ancients

The Church is both a religious institution and a political force. It provides legitimacy to the Colonial Administration and comfort to colonists. But it also has its own agenda: investigating the strange phenomena in the Golden Lands and suppressing information about the Ancient civilization.

**Relationships:**
- **Colonial Administration:** Alliance; the Church provides spiritual legitimacy
- **The Scarlet Company:** Positive; appreciates the creature control that protects colonists
- **[[Ferro]]:** Hostile; condemns their activities and corruption
- **Colonists:** Trusted; the Church is a source of comfort and community
- **Merchants:** Neutral; some are faithful, others are not

### The Merchant Collective

**Leadership:** Informal; influential merchants include [[Elara Coelho]], [[Gregor Madruga]], and others

**Interests:** Profit, stability, reduced taxation, protection from bandits and creatures

**Resources:** Gold, goods, supply lines, information networks

**Weaknesses:** No military force, dependent on guards and mercenaries, vulnerable to extortion

The merchants of Nova Lisboa are not a unified faction, but their shared interests give them collective influence. They want the colony to be stable enough for trade, but they also want minimal interference from the Administration.

**Relationships:**
- **Colonial Administration:** Frustrated; resent taxes but need protection
- **The Scarlet Company:** Positive; hunters make the roads safer
- **[[Ferro]]:** Negative; victims of extortion, some are coerced into cooperation
- **Church of the Red God:** Neutral; some are faithful, business is business
- **Colonists:** Mixed; depend on them for goods, resent high prices

---

### The Underworld

**Leadership:** [[Andrej Vasick]] (smuggling), [[Renato Gomes]] (Golden Ash trade), various smaller operators

**Interests:** Profit from illegal activities, avoid official attention, expand influence

**Resources:** Smuggling networks, gold, information, corrupt connections

**Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to crackdown, dependent on secrecy, fragmented leadership

The underworld of Nova Lisboa is not unified — it's a collection of competing interests. Andrej Vasick runs traditional smuggling (dust, contraband). Ferro runs the more dangerous Golden Ash operation. There are also independent operators running gambling, protection rackets, and information trading.

**Relationships:**
- **Colonial Administration:** Adversarial; the Administration wants to suppress them
- **The Scarlet Company:** Variable; depends on individual hunter choices
- **[[Ferro]]:**
  - **Andrej Vasick:** Competing interests; tension over Golden Ash
  - **Renato Gomes:** Direct competitor in the drug trade
- **Church of the Red God:** Adversarial; the Church condemns their activities
- **Merchants:** Some are partners, others are competitors or victims
- **Colonists:** Some are customers, most are victims of Golden Ash addiction

## Current Conflicts

### The Golden Ash Crisis

**Parties:** Ferro (producers), Andrej Vasick (competing smuggler), Church (against on moral grounds), Administration (against on order grounds), Colonists (victims)

The introduction of Golden Ash has destabilized the colony. The drug is more dangerous than traditional dust, causing violent behavior and death. Ferro profits from it; Andrej Vasick resents the competition and the danger it brings to his operations. The Church condemns it. The Administration wants it stopped but lacks the resources. Colonists are dying.

**Resolution Paths:**
- The player can support Ferro (profit, lose reputation)
- The player can shut down Ferro's operation (gain reputation, make enemy)
- The player can negotiate a settlement (complex outcomes)

### The Protection Racket

**Parties:** Ferro (extortionists), Merchants (victims), Administration (unable to stop it)

Ferro extracts "protection fees" from merchants. The Administration knows but can't act without evidence or resources. Merchants are caught between paying and risking Ferro's wrath, or refusing and hoping the Guard will protect them.

**Resolution Paths:**
- The player can help Elara Coelho resist (confrontation with Ferro)
- The player can negotiate with Ferro (may require payment or other concessions)
- The player can bring evidence to Captain Duarte (Guard raid)

### The Information War

**Parties:** All factions, in various configurations

Everyone in Nova Lisboa wants information: the Administration wants to know about threats, Ferro wants to know about raids, the Church wants to know about Ancient artifacts, merchants want to know about opportunities, the underworld wants to know about enforcement.

**Key Information Brokers:**
- [[Young Paulo]] — Street-level gossip
- [[Tomas Branco]] — Tavern conversations
- [[Andrej Vasick]] — Smuggling networks
- [[Sister Ines Varela]] — Church whispers (unwittingly)
- Ferro soldiers — Coerced informants among the colonists

## Political Landscape Summary

| Faction | Power | Influence | Stability |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Colonial Administration | Official authority, limited resources | High (legitimacy) | Stable but weak |
| Scarlet Company | Combat elite | Moderate (respected) | Stable (new arrivals) |
| Ferro | Numbers, money, connections | Moderate (entrenched) | Unstable (overextended) |
| Church of the Red God | Spiritual authority | High (trusted by colonists) | Stable |
| Merchants | Gold, goods | Moderate (necessary) | Stable |
| Underworld | Gold, information | Low (illicit) | Unstable (competing) |

The player's choices will shift these balances. Supporting one faction may weaken another. Making enemies has consequences. The political landscape of Nova Lisboa is a chessboard, and the Scarlet Company is a powerful piece — but not the only one.
