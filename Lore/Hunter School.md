Hunter Schools were created by legendary monster hunters who were so effective and powerful that the [[Fifth Holy Empire]] decided to create whole institutions to train young citizens with their combat style so that they can fill up the ranks of the elite [[Imperial Blades]].

But from each 100 pupils only 25 would actually survive and/or graduate, and from those only 1 would be selected as new member of the [[Imperial Blades]]. That left 24 very talented fighters without a way to feed themselves. 
And so to prevent the domain from being filled with highly trained and dangerous bandits the [[Fifth Holy Empire]] decided to offer some mercenary companies the exclusive rights to the roster of graduated hunters.
