Manapula de Ferro ("Iron Fist") is a lesser reputable mercenary company that was also given a contract to serve in the taming of the Golden Lands. Founded by a disgraced imperial officer, Ferro recruits from prisons, debtor camps, and failed [[Hunter School]] candidates — anyone desperate enough to fight for coin without asking questions.

Unlike [[The Scarlet Company]], Ferro does not exclusively employ trained Hunters. Their ranks are a mix of ex-soldiers, criminals, and the occasional washout who couldn't cut it at a proper school. What they lack in skill they make up for in numbers and ruthlessness.

Ferro arrived in the [[Golden Lands]] three months before the Scarlet Company and has already embedded itself in Nova Lisboa's power structure. Their field captain, [[Renato Gomes]], has cultivated relationships with local merchants, guard officers, and the colony's underworld. The company runs legitimate monster-hunting contracts during the day and illicit operations at night.

**Reputation:**
- The [[Fifth Holy Empire]] considers them expendable — cheap labor for dangerous work
- [[Captain Duarte Alloro]] despises them but can't remove them without imperial approval
- Colonists fear them — Ferro soldiers are known to shake down merchants for "protection fees"
- The Scarlet Company views them as an embarrassment to the profession

**Key Members in Nova Lisboa:**
- [[Renato Gomes]] — Field Captain, runs the Golden Ash operation
- Ferro Soldiers — rank and file, used as enforcers and drug runners
