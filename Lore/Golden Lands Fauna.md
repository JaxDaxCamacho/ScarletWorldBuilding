# Golden Lands Fauna

The creatures of the Golden Lands are fundamentally different from those of the mainland. Imperial scholars have proposed numerous theories — unique evolution, ancient experiments, divine influence, or the presence of something in the soil or water — but no consensus has been reached. What is known is that the fauna here is larger, more aggressive, and often exhibits behaviors that defy conventional understanding.

## Core Differences from Mainland Fauna

### Size and Ferocity

The most immediately noticeable difference is scale. Creatures in the Golden Lands are uniformly larger than their mainland counterparts. A wolf-sized creature here is the size of a mainland pony. Rodents that would be pests in the Empire become apex predators in the Golden Lands.

This size increase comes with corresponding increases in aggression and territoriality. Golden Lands creatures do not flee from humans — they attack. Colonists have learned that "running away" is rarely an option; the only choices are to fight or to have never been noticed in the first place.

### Unusual Traits

Many Golden Lands creatures exhibit traits that seem impossible or supernatural:

- **Bioluminescence:** Some creatures glow with internal light, particularly those that live in caves or deep forests.
- **Psionic Influence:** Certain species can affect the minds of other creatures, as seen with the barghest's ability to control canines.
- **Elemental Affinities:** Reports exist of creatures that generate heat, cold, or electricity without any apparent biological mechanism.
- **Rapid Adaptation:** Some creatures seem to evolve in real-time, developing resistances to repeated attacks.
- **Colony Intelligence:** What appears to be multiple individuals sometimes operates as a single mind.

### The "Blessed" Phenomenon

Perhaps most disturbingly, some creatures exhibit signs of divine blessing. They glow with golden light, their wounds close impossibly fast, and they seem driven by purposes beyond mere survival. The Church of the Red God is divided on whether this represents true divine favor or some form of corruption. Father Mateus Correia in Nova Lisboa has requested permission to study the phenomenon, but Church leadership has been slow to respond.

## Known Creature Categories

### Canidae Variants

The dog family in the Golden Lands has produced some of the most dangerous creatures encountered by colonists.

**[[Lisboa's Barghest]]**
The most infamous example. A massive canine that exerts psionic control over other canines, creating packs of enslaved dogs to do its bidding. Killed during the [[Territory Dispute]] incident, but scholars believe more exist in the wild.

**Golden Wolves**
Larger than mainland wolves, with fur that seems to shimmer in sunlight. They hunt in coordinated packs and have been known to set ambushes. Their howls can disorient prey.

**Dusk Hounds**
Creatures that only emerge at twilight. They seem to phase in and out of visibility. Colonists report seeing them one moment and nothing the next. Their bites leave wounds that fester despite treatment.

### Insectoid Horrors

The insect population of the Golden Lands has produced creatures that terrify even experienced hunters.

**Flame Centipedes**
Massive centipedes that secrete highly flammable slime. They nest in dark places and are fiercely territorial. Their young are less dangerous but emerge in overwhelming numbers.

**Golden Hornets**
Giant hornets with gold-tinged wings. Their venom causes hallucinations before death. They build nests in tall trees and have been known to attack anyone who comes within a hundred yards of their territory.

**Silk-Weaver Spiders**
Not aggressive unless provoked, but their silk is stronger than steel. Colonists have learned to harvest it carefully for use in armor and tools. The spiders tolerate this as long as their webs aren't damaged.

### Apex Predators

The top of the food chain in the Golden Lands is contested by several species, each terrifying in its own right.

**Sun Stalkers**
Large feline predators that seem to draw power from sunlight. They are faster and stronger during the day, and their hides are prized for their resistance to elemental attacks. They are solitary and highly territorial.

**Ironbacks**
Massive reptilian creatures with natural armor plating. They move slowly but are nearly invulnerable to conventional attacks. The only reliable way to kill them is to find gaps in their armor or use overwhelming force.

**Shadow Cats**
Feline predators that hunt at night. They can blend into darkness and seem to be able to see through all forms of concealment. Their preferred hunting method is to separate prey from the herd before attacking.

### Aquatic Terrors

The waters around the Golden Lands are not well-explored, but what has been found is deeply concerning.

**Mire Wyrms**
Serpentine creatures that live in coastal waters and rivers. They have been known to capsize small boats. Their scales are valuable for alchemy.

**Whisper Eels**
Eels that produce a disorienting sound when agitated. Fishermen report feeling "pulled" toward the water when they catch them. It's unclear if this is a physical effect or something more sinister.

**The Deep Things**
Fishermen speak of things in the deep water that are too large to be any known creature. They've seen shapes that dwarf boats. No confirmed encounters have been recorded, but the stories persist.

## Flora-Fauna Interactions

The creatures of the Golden Lands have developed unique relationships with the native plant life.

**Symbiosis:** Some creatures live in symbiotic relationship with dangerous plants. The creatures protect the plants; the plants provide shelter or food.

**Mimicry:** Certain species have evolved to resemble plants, making them nearly invisible until they strike.

**Mutualism:** There are reports of creatures "farming" — tending to specific plants that provide them with some benefit. This level of intelligence is unprecedented in mainland fauna.

## Scholarly Theories

### The Evolution Theory

Imperial naturalists argue that the Golden Lands simply evolved differently due to isolation. The size increase could be attributed to resource abundance; the unusual traits to unique environmental pressures.

**Weakness:** This theory does not explain the "blessed" creatures or the psionic abilities.

### The Corruption Theory

Some scholars believe the land itself is corrupted, perhaps by an ancient power or event. This corruption manifests in the creatures, making them larger, more aggressive, and sometimes supernatural.

**Weakness:** No source of corruption has been identified, and the land seems otherwise healthy.

### The Divine Theory

The Church of the Red God has proposed that the creatures are a test or punishment from the divine. The "blessed" creatures represent direct intervention, while the general ferocity is meant to challenge the faithful.

**Weakness:** This theory is religious rather than scientific and doesn't explain the mechanisms involved.

### The Remnant Theory

A controversial hypothesis suggests that the creatures are not natural at all, but remnants of an ancient civilization's experiments. The size, the abilities, the intelligence — all could be the result of deliberate manipulation.

**Weakness:** No evidence of such a civilization has been found. Yet.

## Implications for Colonists

The Golden Lands fauna presents unique challenges for colonization:

1. **Settlement Placement:** Must consider territorial boundaries of apex predators.
2. **Agriculture:** Must protect crops from herbivores the size of horses.
3. **Travel:** Requires armed escorts for any journey between settlements.
4. **Resource Extraction:** Mining and logging operations need constant security.
5. **Night Operations:** Effectively impossible in many areas due to nocturnal predators.

The Scarlet Company's contract to clear monsters is not a one-time effort — it's an ongoing necessity for the colony's survival.
