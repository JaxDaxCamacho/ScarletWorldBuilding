A lone man stands nervously outside, glancing around.
This is **Andrej Vasick**, owner of the warehouse lease.

# **Meet the Warehouse Manager**

- Mid-40s, wiry, sweating, clearly stressed
- Is _desperate_ to get inside the warehouse
- The yellow-tinted crates belong to him
- Contain illegal recreational dust imported from the empire
  
### **Opening Dialogue**

**Andrej:**  
“Oh! Scarlet Company, yes? Thank the gods you’re here. That's the infested warehouse. You are twice the man I'll ever be to get in there with blade in hand”

He wrings his hands, glancing toward the sealed warehouse doors.

**Player Options:**

1. **“It's our job. Anything else we should know?”**  
    → Andrej nods rapidly.
	    1.1 "Well, yes... There's a request I'd like to make of you. You see, there's some crates that i need to move as soon as possible, it can't wait until the guard inspects your work and deems the warehouse safe. So if you could let me know when you cleared it, even before you go notify the captain, i would pay 100G extra for the trouble!
	    1.1.1 **So just notifying you on our way to the captain? Sound's like a deal!** [FAME -]
		    1.1.1.1 "Ah thank you Hunter! I'll be eternally grateful!"[Close conversation]
		1.1.2 **Wait... You are paying us to let you move out crates before the guards come in. Clearly illegal goods in that warehouse then.**
			1.1.2.1 "Ah no no! nothing like that, it's just very perishable goods that i would rather not spoil waiting for the bureaucracies of the guard! But you are right, I'll just wait for proper protocol. Forget i mentioned anything"
			1.1.2.1.1 **We are employed by the Holy Empire and the Guard of this city, this is suspicious behavior to say the least, you are coming with us to see the captain!**
			1.1.2.1.1.1 "FUCK! I guess you'll have to go back the mainland in a coffin merc!" [Close Conversation And Start Fight with Andrej] 
			1.1.2.1.2 **So be it. But if we do encounter illegal activities, we will be forced to report them** [FAME +]
			1.1.2.1.2.1 "Of course, I would do the same!"[Close conversation]
		1.1.3 **We'll follow protocol as we should. You should do the same, citizen.**[Close conversation]
    
2. **“Don't worry citizen, we'll have it cleared so you can resume your work soon enough. Now move aside.”** [Close conversation]

# **INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE**

When the player enters:

- The floor is covered with shimmering, yellow-tinted centipede slime
- Some crates are partially dissolved
- Yellow-tinted crates (Andrej’s) are stacked neatly in the back
- Egg clusters cling to rafters
- Strange clicking echoes from the shadows

[Beast Lore > Metamorphosis]The player discovers (via smell or physics) the slime is **flammable**.

### **Player Realization Moment:**

**Narration:**  
Your torch flickers as droplets of centipede slime drip from a crate. When the flame nears the goo, it _hisses_—then pops with a tiny, sharp flare.

**Player Thought:**  
“If fire touches this stuff… the whole building goes up.”

This is where they understand both the danger and the stakes.

# **Encounter starts**
