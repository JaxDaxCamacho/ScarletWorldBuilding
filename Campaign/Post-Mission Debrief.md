# Post-Mission Debrief

**Prerequisite:** Player has completed both [[Territory Dispute]] and [[Sensitive Cargo]]

---

## Return to the Guard Barracks

After completing both contracts, the player returns to [[Captain Duarte Alloro]] at the Guard Barracks.

The captain's demeanor shifts depending on how the missions went.

---

### If BOTH missions went well (Fame+ on both):

**Captain Duarte:**
"I'll be damned. Both contracts done, no buildings burned, no international incidents. Maybe you Scarlet types are worth the coin after all."

He drops a pouch of Crowns on the desk and slides it across.

"150 Crowns for the barghest. 150 for the warehouse. And a word of advice — the [[Ferro]] mercenaries have been getting comfortable while you were working. Their captain, [[Renato Gomes]], has been poking around places he shouldn't be. I don't have proof of anything yet, but keep your eyes open."

**Rewards:**
- 300 Crowns total
- Captain Duarte disposition: Respectful
- Unlocks: [[Drugs Running Rampant]] (if Andrej alive and helped)
- Unlocks: Guard Bounty Board (rotating minor contracts)

---

### If missions were MIXED (one Fame+, one Fame-):

**Captain Duarte:**
"One out of two isn't terrible. For mercenaries."

He pushes coins across with less enthusiasm.

"200 Crowns. You earned... most of it. The Empire expects consistency, Hunter. I suggest you deliver it next time."

He pauses.

"One more thing — those [[Ferro]] lads have been sniffing around. I don't know what they're up to but I don't like it. You see anything, you tell me first. Not them, not the colonists. Me."

**Rewards:**
- 200 Crowns total
- Captain Duarte disposition: Neutral
- Unlocks: [[Drugs Running Rampant]] (if Andrej alive and helped)
- Unlocks: Guard Bounty Board (rotating minor contracts, worse selection)

---

### If BOTH missions went poorly (Fame- on both):

**Captain Duarte:**
"A burned warehouse and a botched hunt. You know, the [[Ferro]] company at least manages to not set things on fire."

He tosses a small pouch on the table.

"100 Crowns. Be grateful I'm paying you at all. The Empire doesn't reward incompetence, and neither do I."

He leans forward.

"I'm giving the next major contract to Ferro. You can pick up the scraps. Unless you can convince me otherwise."

**Rewards:**
- 100 Crowns total
- Captain Duarte disposition: Disappointed
- Unlocks: [[Drugs Running Rampant]] (if Andrej alive and helped)
- Guard Bounty Board: only the worst contracts available. Best contracts go to Ferro first.
- This creates a rivalry dynamic where the player must actively claw back reputation.

## The Ferro Introduction

Regardless of mission outcome, as the player leaves the Guard Barracks, they encounter a Ferro patrol.

### Cutscene

Three soldiers in iron-dark armor block the narrow street. They're laughing at a colonist they've shoved aside. The lead soldier sees you.

**Ferro Soldier:**
"Well, well. Scarlet Company. We heard you finally showed up. Took your time."

**Player Options:**

1. **"Out of my way."**
	1.1 The soldier sneers but steps aside. "Touchy. No wonder they send you lot to do pest control."
	[Close — no further interaction]

2. **"I hear Ferro's been busy. Doing what, exactly?"**
	2.1 "Same as you, Hunter. Serving the Empire. Only difference is — we were here first. This city runs on Ferro efficiency now." He grins. "Ask your captain."
	[Close — plants the seed of Ferro's entrenched position]

3. **"Touch that colonist again and we'll have a problem."** [Intimidation]
	Success: The soldier's grin fades. He releases the colonist and backs off. "Relax, merc. Just having fun." The colonist mouths 'thank you' as they hurry away. [FAME +]
	Failure: "Big words from the new arrival. Walk away, Scarlet." The soldiers close ranks. Nothing happens — but they remember your face.

4. **[Walk past without engaging]**
	The colonist is shoved again. You hear laughter behind you.
