*Unlock Farias House Location* 
## **1. Meet the Widow**

**Location:** A small colonial home, shutters broken, scratch marks on the door.

**NPC:**  
**Nina Farias**

- Widow of Luke Farias
    
- Exhausted, terrified, angry at the guard’s failure
    

### **Opening Dialogue**

**Nina:**  
“Oh… Mercenaries. Took you long enough. They told me you’d be coming. But honestly I just want this over with... I want to go back home...”

**Player Choices:**

1. **“We’re here to help. Please tell us what happened.”**
	1. "There's no point... My Husband died and with him my dreams of a new life in a new land..."
	    1.1 "**Think of other wive's husbands. They might die in the same way if you refuse to help us** [Persuasion]"
	    1.2 "**The Empire needs EVERYONE to do their part, so we can all stay safe, do you understand?** [Intimidation]"
		    Success: "Yes, you are right... This is the location where he would feed those dogs... But I still don't believe those animals would hurt him, they adored him... and he was feeding THEM! How could they be so hungry that they devour him in such a way".
			Failure: "Am i to be arrested because i grieve my husband? I already done my duty and answered all the questions once! go ask the guard, I told them everything! If that's not enough and I am to be arrested, so be it... I have nothing else to lose..."
			1.1.1. [Close Conversation]  **“We got what we came for. Good day ma'am.”**
2. **“You are free do do so, as soon as you give us information.”**
	1. "I don't know much except he was eaten by dogs. The same dogs he used to feed and treat. I can show you where he used to go feed them, but please just let me go."
	2.1. "**As you wish.**" [Close Conversation]
	2.2. **“Could you just tell us if there was anything weird about his last day. Did you notice something out of place with him or the dogs?”** 
		2.2.1 "Well... The night before, the dogs didn't come to him, I remember him talking about it. And the whole Alley smelt like Sage and incense. He complained that probably one of the Red Priests went there to "purify" something or someone. And that was why the dogs weren't there" [Beast Lore > Invocation]
			Success: That sounds like a Barghest. They leave a trace scent of burnt sage and they have psionic influence over other canidae species. We should get something able to create a high pitch noise to disable it's mind bending abilities. This just got more interesting.
			Failure: That doesn't tell us much. Something might've happen to the dogs. Or maybe whatever ate him also ate the dogs the day before. We should be ready for something more dangerous than stray muts.
		[Close Conversation] **Thank you, this was helpful. I hope you can find happiness again, citizen.** 
    
3. [Close Conversation] 
    **“Just point us to where your husband was found and we'll be on our way”**

## **2. Investigation Scene**

By travelling to the Bloodied Alley

Nearby you find:

- Fresh dog prints circling alleys
    
- Drag marks leading into the sewer drain

Player can enter the sewer drain or leave to prepare for combat.

## **3. Enter the sewer drain

The stone steps descend into the old drainage tunnels beneath Nova Lisboa. The air immediately grows colder, thick with the stench of rot and stagnant water. Moisture drips from rusted iron pipes overhead, forming narrow rivulets that trace through piles of muck and half-dissolved refuse.

Torchlight flickers against the tunnel walls, revealing faded murals of the old colonial sewer plans now smeared with claw marks and dark, crusted stains. The distant scuttling of rats suddenly stops. Even vermin don’t dare stay here.

As you round the final bend, your boot splashes into a shallow pool. The sound echoes—too loudly.

And then… movement.

The torchlight washes over **four stray dogs** lying sprawled on the damp stone. For a moment, they look asleep.

Then their heads jerk up in unison.

The dogs rise slowly, stiffly, like puppets pulled upward by invisible strings. Their eyes glow faintly with a sickly blue tint, pupils wide and unfocused. Their bodies are in **horrific condition**—patches of fur missing, flesh torn open where claws or teeth ripped through skin, ribs showing through stretched hide. Their breathing is ragged, wheezing, unnatural.

Strings of drool hang from slack jaws. Flies swarm around open wounds. They look like they should be dead already.

But something forces them to stand.

Something forces them to obey.

**The dogs lower their heads and begin to stalk toward you, growling in the same exact rhythm—perfectly synchronized.**

# **THE BARGHEST APPEARS**

A shadow detaches itself from the darkness behind them.

The barghest rises from the floor on four massive limbs, as if pulled upward from molten tar. Its **black fur is coarse and uneven**, its body far too large for a normal hound. Its eyes burn with predatory intelligence—brighter and far more aware than its thralls.

As it lifts its head, the air fills with a low, vibrating hum—a pulse of telepathic pressure that makes the dogs twitch.

It steps forward, claws scraping stone.  
The pack stiffens, awaiting its silent command.
### **Player Prompt (In-Game Options)**

**→ Use the Bone Whistle**  
You raise the carved bone whistle to your lips and blow.

The shrill sound cuts through the tunnels like a spear of ice.

Instantly, two of the dogs freeze mid-step. Their eyes flicker—once, twice—then the unnatural blue glow shatters like glass. Their bodies collapse to the stone with heavy, unconscious thuds.

Freed.

The other dogs stagger but remain standing—its mind still chained.

# **Encounter starts**

The remaining dog lunges with a tortured howl.  
The barghest charges behind it like a living shadow.
