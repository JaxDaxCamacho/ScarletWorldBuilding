### **Scene: Dockside**

The ship approaches a massive wooden harbor built over strange golden-tinged soil. Smoke rises from the busy colony streets.

You disembark with your teammate (each school will have it's own initial Hireling).  

A stern older man in Lisboan guard armor waits for you.

**Introduce NPC:**  
**Captain Duarte Alloro**

- Commander of Nova Lisboa’s city guard
- Overworked, cynical, but competent
- Does _not_ trust mercenaries but desperately needs them

### **Cutscene / Dialogue**

**Captain Alloro:**  
“Scarlet Company, yes? Good. You’re late. The colonists keep dying at dawn, dusk, and after supper—so unless your ship brought miracles, you’re going straight to work.”

**Player Dialogue Options:**

1. **“We’re ready. Just point us at the problem.”**
    - Captain approves.
	    - "Good, i can see you are Scarlet Company alright. Not like the [[Ferro]] weaklings that die at the same rate the rest of us do."
        
2. **“We were told there’d be an onboarding and gearing up process…”**
    
    - Captain snorts.  
        “This _is_ the onboarding. About the gear feel free to take what's on that chest behind me”
        
3. **“What exactly is killing people inside the city walls?”**
    
    - Leads to optional worldbuilding reveal.
         "The fauna in this godforsaken land is not like back home... Everything seems to have been bred to be ten times deadlier than all the animals we know. And so what we would consider city pests like rats or stray dogs back in the Empire, turn into apex predators on this side of the pond.
         And then there's human nature of course..."

### Captain Duarte Briefs You

Two urgent “pest control” contracts:

1. [[Territory Dispute]] — barghest hunting inside the city
