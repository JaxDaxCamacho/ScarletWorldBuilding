Ancient and cunning, the Adamastor is a grotesque mockery of nature — a towering simian horror that stalks the deepest jungles of the Golden Lands. Its body is powerfully built like a gorilla, but stretched to grotesque proportions, standing over three meters tall. Its face bears an unsettling intelligence behind those bloodshot eyes, and its hands are dexterous enough to wield crude tools or even scavenged weapons. What makes the Adamastor truly monstrous is its hunting method: it specifically targets smaller primates, including humans, and has been observed "playing" with its prey for hours before the final kill. Victims are often found partially consumed while still alive, the Adamastor having carefully removed non-vital parts first. Imperial scholars named it after the mythical giant of Portuguese legend, though most now believe the original Adamastor tales were warnings about these creatures all along.
