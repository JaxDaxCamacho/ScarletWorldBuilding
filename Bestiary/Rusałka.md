Spirits of those who drowned, Rusałkas appear as beautiful women with pale green skin and long hair that is perpetually wet. They emerge from bodies of water at night to dance in meadows, their movements mesmerizing to anyone who witnesses them. Men who are drawn to watch or join the dance find themselves compelled to approach, at which point the Rusałka's true nature reveals itself — her hands become clammy and impossibly strong, her eyes turn to voids, and she drags her victim beneath the water. Some Rusałkas are gentle, asking riddles and releasing those who answer correctly, but in the Golden Lands, the water has twisted them into something hungrier. They have been known to keep victims alive underwater for days, drowning them repeatedly as the Rusałka feeds on their terror. Their hair, when wet, is as strong as rope and nearly unbreakable. The only reliable protection is to carry iron or to know and speak their true name.
