Forest lords of the deep wilderness, Basajaun appear as massive humanoid figures covered in shaggy hair, standing nearly three meters tall. Unlike many creatures of the Golden Lands, Basajaun are not inherently malevolent — they are guardians of the forest who protect animals from excessive hunting and preserve the natural balance. However, their definition of "excessive" includes any human presence in what they consider their territory. They possess an intimate connection with the forest, able to command animals, shape plant growth, and move through woodland without leaving any trace. A Basajaun's howl carries for miles and signals to all creatures in its domain that intruders are present. They avoid direct confrontation when possible, preferring to lead humans into traps, dangerous terrain, or the paths of other predators. When forced to fight, they wield massive wooden clubs with terrifying strength. Some hunters believe Basajaun can be negotiated with through proper rituals, but such attempts have rarely ended well.
