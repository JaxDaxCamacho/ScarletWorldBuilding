A shapeshifting water spirit that lurks in the rivers and lakes of the Golden Lands, the Nøkk is a master of deception. It most commonly appears as a beautiful pale horse by the water's edge, or sometimes as a handsome young man playing a violin. Those who approach the horse to mount it find themselves unable to dismount as it plunges into the water, dragging them to drown in the depths. In human form, the Nøkk's music is irresistibly compelling, drawing victims to walk into the water of their own accord. The Nøkk's true form is something between horse and man, with too-long limbs, bulbous fish-eyes, and kelp for hair. It keeps its victims' belongings arranged in an underwater grotto, occasionally emerging to display them on riverbanks as trophies. The Nøkk cannot cross running water in its horse form and can be repelled by steel or iron, but it is virtually impossible to kill in its aquatic domain.
