The terror of the deep. The Kraken is a colossal cephalopod that dwells in the deepest waters around the Golden Lands. Its body is larger than any ship, and its tentacles can stretch for hundreds of meters. The Kraken creates whirlpools by spinning its massive body, drawing ships and boats toward its waiting maw. Sailors speak of the "Kraken's Breath" — a foul-smelling mist that rises from the water before an attack, warning those wise enough to recognize it. The creature's beak can crack the hull of the strongest vessel. What makes the Kraken truly horrifying is its intelligence — it has been observed herding ships toward each other, creating artificial storms by splashing, and even waiting for rescue ships before attacking again. The Imperial Navy has lost three vessels to confirmed Kraken attacks, and the Church has declared the creature an abomination. The only defense is to avoid deep water and to carry blessed harpoons, though even these have proven of limited effectiveness.
