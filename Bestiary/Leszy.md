The Lord of the Forest. Leszy is a towering humanoid figure, standing over three meters tall, with bark-like skin and branches growing from its head like horns. Its eyes are hollow voids in which falling leaves perpetually drift. Leszy commands all the wildlife within its domain, and the forest itself bends to its will — paths shift, trees move, and sounds distort to confuse intruders. Unlike the Basajaun, Leszy is not a guardian but a ruler, demanding tribute from all who enter its territory. Those who fail to offer appropriate gifts find themselves lost forever as the forest closes around them. Leszy can shrink to the size of a blade of grass or grow to match the tallest tree. It rarely fights directly, preferring to let the forest and its creatures handle intruders, but when cornered, its strength is legendary. Some hunters believe Leszy are not born but created — that the oldest forests of the Golden Lands generate these lords spontaneously.
