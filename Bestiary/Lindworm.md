Serpentine dragons that slither through the deep forests and mountain passes of the Golden Lands, Lindworms are among the most dangerous predators encountered by hunters. Unlike typical dragons, Lindworms have no wings — their bodies are long and snakelike, covered in iridescent scales that range from moss-green to rust-red. Their front legs are powerful and clawed, used to drag their massive bulk through undergrowth, while they possess no hind legs at all. A Lindworm's head is equine in shape, with a flowing mane and eyes that glow with malevolent intelligence. Their venom is corrosive, capable of dissolving flesh and bone within hours. Most disturbingly, Lindworms have been observed cultivating fear — they will intentionally spare victims to spread tales of their horror, drawing more prey to their territory. They hoard not gold, but bones, arranging the skeletons of their victims in elaborate displays.
