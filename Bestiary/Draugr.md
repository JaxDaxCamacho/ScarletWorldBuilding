The dead do not rest easily in the Golden Lands. Draugr are reanimated corpses that guard ancient burial sites — whether these sites belong to an extinct indigenous civilization or something older still, no one knows. Unlike simple zombies, Draugr retain a malevolent intelligence and the memories of their former lives. Their bodies have swollen to impossible proportions, their skin blackened and stretched taut over bulging muscle. They possess impossible strength and can increase their size at will, swelling to fill doorways or crush prey in their grip. The most disturbing aspect is that they seem to enjoy the killing — Draugr have been observed playing with victims, breaking limbs and letting them crawl before finishing them. Fire is the only reliable way to destroy them permanently, though decapitation can incapacitate them temporarily.
