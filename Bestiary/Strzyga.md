Born with two hearts and two souls, the Strzyga appears human during the day but transforms into a nightmarish predator after sunset. In its monstrous form, it resembles a twisted human-bird hybrid, with leathery wings sprouting from its back and a beak-like maw filled with needle teeth. Strzygas feed on blood and life force, but their preferred method is to infiltrate communities, posing as normal people while secretly draining victims over weeks. A fully fed Strzyga can live for centuries, and old Strzygas become increasingly monstrous, developing additional eyes, limbs, and mouths. They are notoriously difficult to kill — each heart must be destroyed separately, and if even one survives, the Strzyga will regenerate. The Church considers them abominations against the natural order, proof of the Red God's disfavor.
