The bogeyman made flesh. El Coco appears as a hunched, child-sized figure wrapped in rags and shadows, its face hidden beneath a hood that seems to absorb all light. It is called by the fear of children — wherever a child is terrified of the dark, of being alone, of the thing in the closet, El Coco can manifest. It feeds on childhood innocence, draining the ability to feel joy or wonder, leaving behind hollow shells that grow into adults plagued by anxiety and darkness. El Coco's true face has never been seen clearly, but glimpses suggest something far more horrifying than any child's imagination could produce — too many teeth, eyes that reflect impossible sights, and a mouth that opens wider than any natural jaw should allow. It is nearly impossible to harm physically, but it can be turned away by protective charms, parental presence, and most effectively by genuine courage in the face of fear.
