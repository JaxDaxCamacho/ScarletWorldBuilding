Ancient beings of immense power, Mouras are the spectral remnants of an elder civilization that once ruled the Golden Lands. They appear as regal women of impossible beauty, draped in golden jewelry and fine silks that shimmer with their own light. Mouras are not malevolent by nature — they are cursed, bound to guard treasures and sacred sites for eternity. However, their curse has driven many to madness over the millennia, and those Mouras have become hostile to all who approach. A Moura's touch can turn flesh to gold, a curse she cannot control. She may offer gifts of great power to those who solve her riddles, but these gifts always carry hidden costs. Some Mouras are known to take mortal lovers, preserving them in an eternal half-life as companions in their lonely vigil. The Church is divided on whether Mouras represent souls in need of salvation or dangerous entities to be destroyed.
