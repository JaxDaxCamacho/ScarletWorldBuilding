A serpentine dragon of Iberian legend, twisted by the Golden Lands into something far more terrible. The Coca appears as a massive winged serpent, its scales a patchwork of rust-red and sickly green, its wings tattered but functional. What distinguishes the Coca from other dragons is its hunger for celebration — it is drawn to festivals, gatherings, and moments of joy, which it interrupts with devastating attacks. The Coca's venom causes severe hallucinations, making victims see their loved ones as monsters and attack them. The creature has been known to let survivors escape, spreading tales of its horror, which it seems to feed upon. Unlike most dragons, the Coca can shape-shift into human form, allowing it to infiltrate settlements and identify the most devastating time to strike. Its only known weakness is its reflection — seeing itself in a mirror causes it intense pain and can drive it away.
