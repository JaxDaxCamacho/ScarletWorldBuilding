Seductive forest spirits of breathtaking beauty, Huldras appear as beautiful women with one carefully concealed secret — their backs are hollow, like the inside of a rotten tree, and their tails are that of a fox or cow. Huldras lure men into the forest with their beauty and their song, and those who are polite and respectful may be released with good fortune. But those who are crude, who discover her secret and mock it, or who attempt to harm her are doomed. A rejected or angered Huldra will curse her victim to a life of madness, obsession, or physical decline. In the Golden Lands, Huldras have grown darker — they no longer release those they capture, keeping men as servants or lovers until age or accident claims them. Some Huldras have been known to steal children, raising them in the forest until they forget their human lives entirely. Iron burns them, and knowing their true names can force them to release their captives.
