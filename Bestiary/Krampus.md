A horned devil that stalks the Golden Lands during the darkest nights of winter, Krampus is a creature of punishment and terror. Standing over two meters tall, covered in dark matted fur, with a lolling tongue and sharp horns curling from its head, Krampus carries chains and a bundle of birch branches. It does not kill — it captures. Those it deems wicked are beaten with the branches, stuffed into its sack, and carried away to an unknown fate. Survivors of Krampus encounters describe an overwhelming sense of judgment, as if the creature were weighing their sins. In the Golden Lands, Krampus has grown more active and less bound to season — hunters report encounters throughout the year. The creature seems particularly drawn to those with guilty consciences, suggesting some form of moral or spiritual awareness. Blessed chains can bind it temporarily, and genuine remorse can cause it to lose interest in a victim.
