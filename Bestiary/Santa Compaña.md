A procession of the damned that appears on moonless nights, the Santa Compaña is a ghostly parade of the dead, led by a living person cursed to carry the cross and cauldron of holy water at its head. The procession winds through settlements and roads in absolute silence, its members' eyes burning with cold blue fire. Anyone who witnesses the Santa Compaña must hide their face and pray — to be seen by the procession is to be marked for death, either taken to join the parade or cursed to carry the cross in the leader's place. The current cross-bearer is always recognizable in life: pale, progressively weaker, and compelled to walk specific paths each night. When they die, they become a permanent member of the procession, and the curse passes to the next victim. The only escape is to pass the curse to another through trickery — a dark choice that has driven many to madness. The Church considers the Santa Compaña one of the most dangerous supernatural phenomena in the Golden Lands.
