A specter that materializes only during the height of the midday sun, when shadows shrink to nothing and the heat becomes oppressive. The Noon Witch appears as an emaciated crone wrapped in tattered white linens, her face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat. She manifests suddenly in fields and open spaces, demanding tribute from anyone unlucky enough to encounter her. Those who cannot answer her riddles or offer suitable payment are subjected to her harvest — she uses a rusted sickle to cut pieces from the living, collecting fingers, ears, and tongues which she stores in a burlap sack. The wounds she inflicts never heal properly, and survivors report persistent pain during noon for the rest of their lives. She cannot be harmed by conventional weapons, but she can be banished if her true name is spoken or if she is doused with blessed water.
