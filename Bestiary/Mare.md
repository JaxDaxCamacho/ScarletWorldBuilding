A parasitic spirit that rides upon the chest of sleepers, the Mare is the source of nightmares in the Golden Lands. It appears as a wispy, vaguely equine shape made of shadow, barely visible even in direct light. The Mare does not kill directly — instead, it feeds on fear and despair, inducing horrific visions in its victims night after night. Those who survive a Mare's attention wake exhausted, their bodies weakened as if they had run for miles. Over weeks or months, victims waste away, their minds fragmenting under the accumulated trauma. Eventually, the Mare may consume enough of a victim's life force that they simply do not wake at all. Mares are drawn to settlements and will infest areas where many people sleep close together, cycling through victims to avoid killing any single one too quickly. They can be repelled by certain herbs and charms, but destroying them requires specialized blessed weapons.
