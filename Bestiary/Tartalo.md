A massive cyclopean giant that haunts the mountainous regions of the Golden Lands, Tartalo stands over four meters tall, its single eye glowing with malevolent intelligence. Its body is covered in coarse dark hair, and it possesses strength sufficient to tear trees from the ground and wield them as clubs. Tartalo captures humans to keep as livestock, keeping prisoners in caves and eating them slowly over time. What makes Tartalo truly monstrous is its games — it enjoys offering captives apparent chances at escape, only to hunt them down for sport. Its single eye can see through all forms of concealment and invisibility, making stealth impossible against it. The creature is immensely resistant to damage, its thick hide turning aside most attacks. The only reliable weakness is its eye — a blinded Tartalo becomes erratic and can be led to fall from cliffs or into traps. However, Tartalo are intelligent enough to protect this vulnerability.
