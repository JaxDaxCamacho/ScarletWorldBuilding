## Description

Farpoint is the most remote Imperial outpost in the Golden Lands — a small fortified position on a rocky peninsula, overlooking the ocean. Its official purpose is to watch for ships approaching from unexpected directions and to serve as a resupply point for coastal patrols.

In practice, Farpoint is where the Empire sends people it wants to forget. Guards who've made enemies, priests who've asked the wrong questions, and bureaucrats who've failed in ways that can't be punished openly but must be removed. It's a posting of last resort — cold, isolated, and boring.

Or at least, it was boring. Something has changed. The guards have been reporting lights on the horizon at night — ships that don't match any known design. And the priest has started having visions that she refuses to discuss.

## Notable Features

**The Watchtower:** A stone tower with a signal fire at the top. The primary purpose of Farpoint is to maintain this fire and watch for approaching ships.

**The Barracks:** Cramped quarters for the guards. Morale is low, discipline is lower, and no one wants to be here.

**The Chapel:** A small Red God shrine maintained by Sister Madalena Costa. It's the only quiet place in the outpost.

**The Caves:** Natural sea caves beneath the peninsula. Officially unexplored. Unofficially, some guards have been sneaking down there, looking for treasure or escape.

**The Ledge:** A cliff overlooking the ocean. Guards come here to think, pray, or just be alone. Some have been found standing at the edge, staring at the water, for hours.

## Atmosphere

Farpoint is cold, windswept, and lonely. The sound of waves crashing against the cliffs is constant. The guards have developed their own rituals to pass the time — games, songs, bets on how long new arrivals will last.

But lately, there's been a shift. More guards are spending time alone. Conversations are shorter. And at night, when the signal fire is lit, some claim to see shapes moving in the darkness beyond the light's reach.

## Key NPCs

**Watch Commander Isa Santos:** A competent officer who was sent to Farpoint after reporting corruption in Nova Lisboa. She keeps her guards alive but has no love for the Empire that exiled her here.

**Sister Madalena Costa:** The outpost's Red Priest. Young, earnest, and increasingly troubled by visions she doesn't understand. She's sent letters to the Church hierarchy but received no response.

**Guard Private Tomas Ribeiro:** The most recent transfer. He's been here two weeks and is already showing signs of the isolation that breaks most guards.

**Guard Corporal Lena Faria:** A veteran of Farpoint who's been here longer than anyone. She knows the outpost's secrets — including what happened to the guards who explored the caves.

## Quest Hooks

- **[[The Cave Expedition]]** — Something in the sea caves is calling to the guards. Discover what — before more of them disappear.

## Random Encounters

2. Sister Madalena is praying in the chapel. She looks like she hasn't slept in days.
3. A game of dice in the barracks turns ugly. Someone accuses someone else of cheating.
