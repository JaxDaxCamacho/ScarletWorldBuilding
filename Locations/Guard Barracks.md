## Description

The Guard Barracks is the headquarters of Nova Lisboa's colonial security force. It's a fortified building near the center of town, constructed from stone shipped from the mainland and reinforced with local timber. The architecture is purely functional — meant to withstand attacks rather than impress visitors.

The building houses the Guard's armory, holding cells, administrative offices, and sleeping quarters for the guards. Captain Duarte Alloro runs operations from his office on the second floor, where a large map of the colony covers one wall, marked with pins indicating recent incidents.

## Notable Features

**The Duty Board:** A large board in the entrance hall where guards sign in for shifts and bounties are posted for hunters. This is where players can find minor contracts when not on main story missions.

**Holding Cells:** Four underground cells for temporary detention. Currently holds a few drunks, a pickpocket, and occasionally captured Ferro soldiers (briefly, before they "escape" or get released due to "lack of evidence").

**The Armory:** A secured room containing Guard weapons and armor. Not available for purchase, but Captain Duarte may loan equipment for specific missions.

**Interrogation Room:** A small room with a table and chairs. Used for questioning suspects. The walls are soundproofed — or at least thick enough that screams don't carry.

**Captain's Office:** Duarte's private workspace. Contains the colony map, his personal files, and a bottle of imported whiskey for "medicinal purposes."

## Atmosphere

The Guard Barracks smells of leather, metal polish, and unwashed men. It's perpetually busy — guards coming and going, prisoners being processed, colonists filing complaints that will likely never be addressed. The mood is tense but professional. These are overworked men and women trying to maintain order in a frontier town that grows more dangerous by the day.

Captain Duarte's presence keeps morale from collapsing entirely. He may be cynical, but he's fair, and his guards respect him even if they don't always like him.
