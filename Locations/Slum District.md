## Description

The Slum District is where Nova Lisboa dumps its unwanted: failed colonists, debtors, the sick, and those who came seeking paradise but found only hardship. The buildings here are ramshackle constructions built too close together, with makeshift shelters filling the gaps. Open sewers run through the streets, and disease is common.

Despite its squalor, the Slum District has a community. People look out for each other because no one else will. There's an informal economy of labor, scavenging, and petty crime. The Guard rarely patrols here, and when they do, it's usually to collect bodies rather than prevent crime.

## Notable Features

**The Commons:** An open area where the desperate gather around burning barrels for warmth. This is where information flows freely — for a price.

**Mother Helena's Kitchen:** A soup kitchen run by an elderly woman who came to the Golden Lands with nothing and decided to help others in the same situation. She's respected by everyone, even criminals.

**The Fighting Pits:** An underground venue where people gamble on bare-knuckle fights. Run by a former Ferro soldier who went independent.

**Abandoned Warehouse:** Used for various illegal activities. Currently serving as a distribution point for [[Golden Ash]] (see [[Drugs Running Rampant]]).

## Atmosphere

The Slum District is perpetually dim — buildings block most sunlight, and the air is thick with smoke from cook fires and burning barrels. The smell of sewage, unwashed bodies, and cooking food mingles into something uniquely terrible.

At night, the district becomes dangerous. [[Ferro]] mercenaries patrol to collect protection money, and street gangs fight over territory. Residents lock themselves inside whatever shelter they have and pray for dawn.

## Connected NPCs
