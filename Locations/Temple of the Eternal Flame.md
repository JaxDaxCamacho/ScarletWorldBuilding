## Description

A modest stone building constructed from imperial-standard materials, the Temple of the Eternal Flame serves as the spiritual heart of Nova Lisboa. Unlike the grand cathedrals of the mainland, this temple is functional rather than impressive — built quickly to serve colonists who needed comfort more than architectural splendor.

The central feature is the **Sacred Hearth**, a large fire pit that burns continuously. According to Red God doctrine, the flame represents the sun's earthly presence and must never be extinguished. The fire is tended by lay brothers in shifts, and extinguishing it deliberately is considered a capital offense.

## Interior Layout

**Main Chamber:** Open floor with wooden pews, the Sacred Hearth at the center, and a stone altar at the far end. The walls are decorated with simple tapestries depicting the Red God's tenets — fire as purification, sun as truth, and ash as renewal.

**Side Chapels:** Two small alcoves for private prayer and last rites. One contains a basin of blessed oil for anointing the sick and dying.

**Priest's Quarters:** A back room where Father Mateus and Sister Ines sleep and keep their personal effects. Contains a small library of religious texts and Father Mateus's private correspondence with church leadership in the Empire.

**Crypt:** A basement level where colonists who died in the Golden Lands are interred. The soil here is considered hallowed ground, though some whisper that the dead don't always stay quiet...
