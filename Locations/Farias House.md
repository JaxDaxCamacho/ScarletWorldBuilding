# Farias House

**Location Type:** Residential
**District:** Lower Residential, Nova Lisboa
**Occupant:** [[Nina Farias]]
**Status:** Damaged (scratch marks on door, broken shutters)

---

## Description

A small colonial home, one of dozens built for the first wave of settlers. It was meant to be the beginning of a new life for Luke and Nina Farias. Now it's a reminder of what was lost — the door is scratched from claw marks, the shutters hang crooked, and the interior is slowly falling into disrepair.

Nina still lives here, though she's been talking about returning to the Empire. She can't bring herself to leave yet — this was supposed to be their home. But every night, she hears the dogs howling in the distance, and wonders if the barghest that killed her husband knows where she lives.

## Notable Features

**The Front Door:** Still bears deep claw marks from the night the dogs tried to get in. Luke wasn't home — he was feeding the strays. Nina was inside, listening to her husband die.

**Luke's Workbench:** A corner of the main room where Luke kept his tools and odds and ends. He was a carpenter by trade. Nina hasn't touched it since his death.

**The Bedroom:** Still contains Luke's clothes in the wardrobe. Nina sleeps in the small servant's room at the back — she can't bear to sleep in their bed.

**The Kitchen:** The only room Nina keeps clean. She still cooks for one, mechanically, as if expecting Luke to walk through the door.

## Atmosphere

The house feels like a tomb. Dust settles on surfaces that were once polished daily. The air is stale, the windows rarely opened. Nina moves through the rooms like a ghost, going through motions without purpose.

At night, the house creaks and groans with the wind. Every sound makes Nina freeze, her hand moving to the knife she keeps by her side. She knows, rationally, that the barghest was killed. But something still howls in the city at night. And she doesn't know what it is.

## Quest Hooks

- **[[Luke's Belongings]]** — Nina asks the player to retrieve her husband's personal effects from the sewer where he died. She wants something to remember him by.
- **[[The Second Howl]]** — Nina reports that she's heard howling again. Is there another barghest? Or something else?
- **[[Moving On]]** — Nina is considering leaving. She needs someone to help her sell the house and arrange passage back to the Empire.
- **[[A Widow's Request]]** — Nina wants to know more about how her husband died. The official report was incomplete. She needs closure.

## Random Encounters

1. Nina is sitting at the table, staring at nothing. She doesn't notice the player at first.
2. A neighbor stops by with food. They exchange pleasantries, but the air is heavy with unspoken grief.
3. Nina is trying to repair the shutters herself. She's not very good at it.
4. The house is dark. Nina is either out or doesn't want visitors.
5. A package has been delivered — Luke's personal effects, finally returned by the Guard.
