# Outlying Settlements

The Golden Lands colony consists of more than just Nova Lisboa. The Fifth Holy Empire has established several outlying settlements, each with its own purpose, population, and problems. These settlements are connected by dangerous roads where creatures roam and travelers disappear.

## Settlement Hierarchy

**Primary Settlement:** [[Nova Lisboa]] — The main colonial city, administrative center, and primary port.

**Secondary Settlements:** Towns with populations of 50-200, established for specific purposes (mining, farming, strategic position).

**Outposts:** Small fortified positions with 10-30 people, usually military or resource extraction.

**Homesteads:** Individual farms or small family groups living outside the protection of larger settlements.

## Current Settlements

| Settlement | Type | Population | Purpose | Status |
|------------|------|------------|---------|--------|
| [[Serra Alta]] | Secondary | ~150 | Mining (iron, silver) | Active |
| [[Porto Verde]] | Secondary | ~180 | Farming, timber | Struggling |
| [[Fortaleza do Norte]] | Outpost | ~40 | Military watchpost | Secure |
| [[Vale dos Mortos]] | Secondary | ~90 | Former mining, now abandoned | Contested |
| [[Farpoint]] | Outpost | ~25 | Coastal watch, resupply | Isolated |

## Travel Between Settlements

Travel between settlements is dangerous. The roads are barely more than cleared paths through wilderness, and creatures are active at all hours. Most travel happens in armed caravans, and even then, losses are common.

**Travel Times (with armed escort):**
- Nova Lisboa to Serra Alta: 3 days
- Nova Lisboa to Porto Verde: 2 days
- Nova Lisboa to Fortaleza do Norte: 4 days
- Nova Lisboa to Vale dos Mortos: 2 days
- Nova Lisboa to Farpoint: 5 days

**Travel Risks:**
- Creature attacks (random encounters)
- Bandit activity (rare but increasing)
- Weather hazards (unpredictable in Golden Lands)
- Getting lost (poorly marked roads)

## Communication

Official communication between settlements happens via messenger riders. These riders are well-armed and travel light, making them faster but more vulnerable. Unofficial communication travels with caravans, merchants, and sometimes through the Church of the Red God's network of temples.

The Guard maintains a signal tower system between Nova Lisboa and Fortaleza do Norte — fires lit at night can relay simple messages in emergencies.
