## Description

The Market District is the commercial heart of Nova Lisboa. What began as a few hastily erected stalls has grown into a bustling center of trade where colonists, soldiers, and mercenaries buy, sell, and haggle over everything from basic supplies to exotic goods imported from the Empire.

The district is organized roughly by trade — blacksmiths and armorers cluster near one end, food vendors in the center, and luxury goods dealers near the entrance where newly arrived colonists are most likely to see them. The cobblestone streets are perpetually muddy, and the noise of commerce never quite stops.

## Notable Features

**The Notice Board:** A large wooden board near the district entrance where the Guard posts official bounties and colonists pin requests for help. This is where most hunters find work when they're not under direct contract.

**The Weighing Station:** Official imperial scales where goods are weighed and taxed. Colonists grumble about the fees but pay them rather than face the Guard's attention.

**The Caravan Loading Area:** An open space where supply wagons from the coast unload goods. Sometimes these caravans bring news from the Empire; sometimes they bring trouble.

## Atmosphere

During the day, the Market District is crowded and loud. Merchants shout prices, children dart between stalls, and guards patrol in pairs. At night, most stalls close, but The Gilded Barrel remains open, its lanterns casting warm light onto empty streets.

The mood has grown tense in recent weeks. [[Ferro]] mercenaries have been shaking down merchants, and there's talk of forming a citizens' watch. [[Captain Duarte Alloro]] has publicly condemned the extortion but claims he doesn't have the manpower to stop it.
