## Description

The Docks District is the lifeblood of Nova Lisboa — the point where ships from the Empire unload supplies, colonists, and occasionally trouble. It's a chaotic sprawl of wooden piers, warehouses, and loading cranes, perpetually busy with sailors, dockworkers, merchants, and those looking to make a quick coin (legally or otherwise).

The district operates on its own rhythms, dictated by the tides and ship schedules. At dawn, fishing boats depart. At midday, the main supply ships arrive. At night, the warehouses become shadows where deals are made away from official eyes.

## Notable Features

**The Main Harbor:** Three large piers can accommodate imperial ships. The harbor master's office controls docking permissions and collects customs fees.

**Warehouse Row:** A line of storage buildings where goods are held before distribution. Includes Warehouse 17 (site of [[Sensitive Cargo]]). Some warehouses are legitimate; others serve as fronts for smuggling operations.

**Customs Office:** The official point of entry for all goods. Corrupt officials can be bribed to overlook certain cargoes. Honest officials are overworked and underpaid.

**Fisher's Pier:** A smaller pier where local fishermen dock. Their catches feed the colony, and they're a good source of information about anything unusual in the water.

**The Broken Mast:** A rough tavern popular with sailors and dockworkers. Cheaper and more dangerous than The Gilded Barrel, but also more discrete.

## Atmosphere

The Docks smell of salt, fish, and tar. The constant noise of shouted orders, creaking ropes, and splashing water creates a cacophony that locals tune out but visitors never quite adjust to. During the day, the district is crowded and chaotic. At night, it becomes quiet — except for the sounds of illicit activity.

The Docks are where you go when you want something unofficial. [[Andrej Vasick]] operates here. Information flows freely if you know who to ask. And the fishermen have stories about things they've seen in the water — things with too many eyes, or too many limbs.

## Quest Hooks
