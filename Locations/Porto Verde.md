## Description

Porto Verde ("Green Port" — though it's nowhere near water) was supposed to be the colony's breadbasket. Rich soil and abundant timber made it seem like the perfect location for a farming settlement. And for a while, it was — the first harvests were bountiful, the lumber was high quality, and the future looked bright.

But something has changed. The crops are still growing, but they're wrong — strange colors, unusual shapes, flavors that don't match the plants they came from. The livestock are restless. And the children have started having the same nightmare: a green light in the forest, calling to them.

## Notable Features

**The Great Fields:** Endless rows of grain and vegetables, tended by farmers who are increasingly reluctant to eat what they grow. The crops grow faster here than anywhere else — unnaturally fast.

**The Timber Mill:** A large operation processing trees from the surrounding forest. The loggers have started refusing to work certain sections — they say the trees there "don't want to be cut."

**The Meeting Hall:** The center of town governance. Currently the site of heated debates about whether Porto Verde should be evacuated or if the problems will "pass."

**The Old Shrine:** A structure predating the Empire's arrival, found when the town was first built. The Church of the Red God blessed it and repurposed it, but some say the original carvings can still be seen beneath the holy symbols.

## Atmosphere

Porto Verde is a town on edge. On the surface, it seems prosperous — the fields are green, the mills are running, the stores are full. But there's a tension in every conversation, a glance over every shoulder, a reluctance to discuss what happens at night.

The children are the worst affected. They play during the day, but at night, they all have the same dream. Parents have taken to sleeping in shifts, watching their children for signs of sleepwalking. Some families have already left for Nova Lisboa.

## Key NPCs

**Mayor Carmo Dias:** Elected leader of Porto Verde. A former farmer who genuinely cares about the town but is out of his depth. Wants to believe the problems will pass but is preparing for evacuation.

**Father Lucas:** The Red Priest assigned to Porto Verde. Has been conducting purification rituals, but they don't seem to be working. Has sent a letter to [[Father Mateus Correia]] requesting guidance.

**Logger Chief Bruno Mendes:** Leader of the timber crews. His men have started reporting that some trees bleed when cut. He's lost three workers who refused to go back into the forest.

**Farmer's Wife Teresa Ribeiro:** Her daughter was the first child to have "the dream." Now she's organizing the parents, demanding answers from anyone who will listen.

## Quest Hooks

- **[[The Green Light]]** — Investigate the forest where the children's dreams seem to originate. Find out what's calling to them.
- **[[Bleeding Trees]]** — Loggers are finding trees that bleed when cut. Is this a curse, a creature, or something stranger?

- **[[Harvest of Horrors]]** — The mutated crops need to be investigated before they reach Nova Lisboa's food supply.
- **[[The Children's Dream]]** — Multiple children are having the same nightmare. Find out what's causing it and stop it.

## Random Encounters

1. A farmer shows the player a potato that's the wrong color — purple instead of brown. It's warm to the touch.
2. Children are playing a game in the square. They're all chanting the same phrase, over and over. They don't know what it means.
3. A logger is refusing to go back to work. "The trees know," he keeps saying. "They know."
4. Father Lucas is conducting a purification ritual at the edge of town. It doesn't seem to be working.
5. A family is packing a cart, preparing to leave for Nova Lisboa. They refuse to say why.
