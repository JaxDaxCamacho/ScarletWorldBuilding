## Description

Serra Alta ("High Ridge") is a mining town built into the foothills of a mountain range to the north of Nova Lisboa. The town exists to extract minerals from the rich veins discovered during early exploration. What started as a crude camp has evolved into a rough but functional settlement with a smithy, a crude tavern, and rows of miners' barracks.

The town is built on terraces carved into the mountainside, connected by steep paths and wooden stairs. At the top sits the Mine Office, where the Mining Guild representative oversees operations. At the bottom, the smelting works and loading area where ore is prepared for transport to Nova Lisboa.

## Notable Features

**The Iron Vein:** The main mine shaft, descending deep into the mountain. Workers have reported strange sounds from the lower levels — echoes that don't match any tool, whispers in languages no one recognizes.

**The Silver Find:** A recently discovered silver vein has the Mining Guild excited. But the miners who work that section have been acting strangely — sleepwalking, muttering, drawing symbols they can't explain.

**The Deep Shaft:** An older mine that was sealed after a collapse killed twelve miners. Officially closed. Unofficially, some say they've seen lights coming from the entrance at night.

**The Forge:** A large smithy where ore is processed before transport. Run by a mute smith named Old Tomas who communicates through gestures and has been here longer than anyone remembers.

## Atmosphere

Serra Alta is a town of hard work and harder people. The air is thick with smoke from the smelters and the dust of constant excavation. Miners work in shifts that blur together, sleeping in cramped barracks and drinking away their wages in the town's single tavern.

There's tension beneath the surface — the silver find should be good news, but the workers are unsettled. The Mining Guild representative dismisses their concerns as superstition, but even he has started locking his door at night.

## Key NPCs

**Mine Supervisor Rodrigo Barbosa:** The Mining Guild representative. Middle-aged, profit-focused, dismisses "miner superstition." Secretly worried that the silver vein might be cursed but refuses to admit it.

**Guard Commander Helena Sousa:** The head of the Guard detachment assigned to protect the mine. Competent, respected by her soldiers, growing increasingly concerned about the reports from the silver mine. Has sent three requests to Nova Lisboa for additional support.

**Old Tomas:** The mute smith. Communicates through gestures. Knows more than he says. Miners believe he's been here since before the Empire arrived — impossible, but the claim persists.

**Miner Katya Velasquez:** A miner who survived the Deep Shaft collapse. Refuses to work in the silver mine. Claims she saw something in the darkness before the collapse — something that wasn't human.

## Quest Hooks
